{{particular group}}

==Definition==

The <math>(7,3,2)</math>-von Dyck group, also sometimes termed the <math>(2,3,7)</math>-von Dyck group, is defined as the [[member of family::von Dyck group]] with parameters <math>(7,3,2)</math>. In other words, it has the presentation:

<math>\langle a,b,c \mid a^7 = b^3 = c^2 = abc = e \rangle</math>

where <math>e</math> denotes the identity element.

This group is also sometimes termed the <math>(7,3,2)</math>-triangle group, though that name is also used for the [[(7,3,2)-triangle group]], in which this is a [[subgroup of index two]].

==Definition==

===Definition with symbols===

A [[subgroup]] <math>H</math> of a [[group]] <math>G</math> is termed a <math>1</math>-'''automorphism-invariant''' subgroup if any [[defining ingredient::1-automorphism of a group|1-automorphism]] of <math>G</math> sends <math>H</math> to itself. In other words, for every 1-automorphism <math>\varphi</math> of <math>G</math>, <math>\varphi(H) \subseteq H</math>.

==Formalisms==

{{frexp}}

The property of being a 1-automorphism-invariant subgroup can be expressed as an {{invariance property}}:

[[1-automorphism]] <math>\to</math> Function

In other words, <math>H</math> is a 1-automorphism-invariant subgroup of a group <math>G</math> if and only if every 1-automorphism of <math>G</math> restricts to a function from <math>H</math> to itself.

Alternative function restriction expressions are:

* [[1-automorphism]] <math>\to</math> [[1-endomorphism]]
* [[1-automorphism]] <math>\to</math> [[1-automorphism]]. This shows that the property of being a 1-automorphism-invariant subgroup is a {{balanced subgroup property}} with respect to 1-automorphisms.

==Examples==

* In any group, the whole group and the trivial subgroup are 1-automorphism-invariant.
* In a cyclic group, every subgroup is 1-automorphism-invariant.
* If the set of elements of order <math>n</math> form a subgroup for any particular <math>n</math>, then that subgroup is 1-automorphism-invariant. This is because 1-automorphisms preserve the orders of elements.

==Definition==

Suppose <math>G_1</math> and <math>G_2</math> are [[group]]s. We say that <math>G_1</math> and <math>G_2</math> are '''1-isomorphic''' if there exists a [[1-isomorphism of groups|1-isomorphism]] between <math>G_1</math> and <math>G_2</math>, i.e., a [[1-homomorphism of groups]] from <math>G_1</math> to <math>G_2</math> whose inverse is also a 1-homomorphism. In other words, there is a bijection between <math>G_1</math> and <math>G_2</math> whose restriction to any cyclic subgroup on either side is an isomorphism to its image.

===Historical term===

G. A. Miller used the term ''conformal groups'' to describe what are referred to here are 1-isomorphic groups. However, the term "conformal group" has a different, much more famous meaning as the group of angle-preserving symmetries of a geometric space.

==Finite version==

Two finite groups that are 1-isomorphic are termed [[1-isomorphic finite groups]]. There are many equivalent characterizations of 1-isomorphic finite groups.

==Facts==

Any [[Lazard Lie group]] is 1-isomorphic to the additive group of its Lazard Lie ring. This shows that many [[group of prime power order|groups of small prime power order]] are 1-isomorphic to [[abelian group of prime power order|abelian groups]]. {{further|[[Lazard Lie group is 1-isomorphic to the additive group of its Lazard Lie ring]]}}

===Lie algebra===

{{further|[[2-sub-ideal of a Lie algebra]]}}

A 2-sub-ideal of a Lie algebra is a 2-sub-ideal of a Lie ring that is also a linear subspace.

Note that there is a somewhat subtle but important point here. For the definition of 2-sub-ideal, we need it to be an ideal of an ideal of the whole ring. It turns out that, if the bottom subset is a linear subspace of the Lie algebra, we can choose the intermediate ideal to also be a linear subspace, and hence to be an ideal in the Lie algebra sense.

{{intransitive}}

A 2-subnormal subgroup of a 2-subnormal subgroup is not necessarily 2-subnormal. {{proofat|[[2-subnormality is not transitive]]}}

{{further|[[Normality is not transitive]], [[there exist subgroups of arbitrarily large subnormal depth]], [[normal not implies left-transitively fixed-depth subnormal]], [[normal not implies right-transitively fixed-depth subnormal]]}}

{{trim}}

Every group is 2-subnormal as a subgroup of itself, and further, the trivial subgroup is 2-subnormal in any group.

This follows from the fact that every group is ''normal'' in itself and the trivial subgroup is also normal in every group. {{proofat|[[trivial subgroup is normal]], [[every group is normal in itself]]}}

{{intersection-closed}}

An arbitrary intersection of 2-subnormal subgroups is 2-subnormal. {{proofat|[[2-subnormality is strongly intersection-closed]]}}

{{not join-closed}}

An arbitrary join of 2-subnormal subgroups need not be 2-subnormal. In fact, even a join of two 2-subnormal subgroups need not be 2-subnormal. {{proofat|[[2-subnormality is not finite-join-closed]]}}

{{conjugate-join-closed}}

A join of 2-subnormal subgroups that are conjugate to each other is again 2-subnormal. {{proofat|[[2-subnormality is conjugate-join-closed]]}}

{{intsubcondn}}

If <math>H</math> is a 2-subnormal subgroup of <math>G</math>, then <math>H</math> is also 2-subnormal in any intermediate subgroup <math>K</math> of <math>G</math>. {{proofat|[[2-subnormality satisfies intermediate subgroup condition]]}}

{{transfercondn}}

If <math>H</math> is a 2-subnormal subgroup of <math>G</math> and <math>K</math> is ''any'' subgroup of <math>G</math>, then <math>H \cap K</math> is 2-subnormal in <math>K</math>. {{proofat|[[2-subnormality satisfies transfer condition]]}}

{{imagecondn}}

If <math>f:G \to K</math> is a surjective homomorphism of groups, and <math>H</math> is 2-subnormal in <math>G</math>, then <math>f(H)</math> is 2-subnormal in <math>K</math>.

{{not upper join-closed}}

If <math>H \le G</math> and <math>K, L</math> are two intermediate subgroups containing <math>H</math>, it may happen that <math>H</math> is 2-subnormal in <math>K</math> as well as in <math>L</math>, but is not 2-subnormal in <math>\langle K, L \rangle</math>. {{proofat|[[2-subnormality is not upper join-closed]]}}

{{applyingoperatorgives|right transiter|right-transitively 2-subnormal subgroup}}

The right transiter of the property of being 2-subnormal is termed the property of being '''right-transitively 2-subnormal'''. A subgroup <math>H</math> of a group <math>G</math> is termed right-transitively 2-subnormal if any 2-subnormal subgroup <math>K</math> of <math>H</math> is 2-subnormal in <math>G</math>.

Some subgroup properties stronger than being right-transitively 2-subnormal include: [[base of a wreath product]], [[transitively normal subgroup]], and [[normal subgroup]] that is also a [[T-group]] (for instance, an [[Abelian normal subgroup]]).

{{applyingoperatorgives|left transiter|left-transitively 2-subnormal subgroup}}

The left transiter of the property of being 2-subnormal is termed the property of being '''left-transitively 2-subnormal'''. A subgroup <math>H</math> of a group <math>G</math> is termed left-transitively 2-subnormal if whenever <math>G</math> is embedded as a 2-subnormal subgroup of some group <math>K</math>, <math>H</math> is also 2-subnormal in <math>K</math>.

Any [[characteristic subgroup]] is left-transitively 2-subnormal, because the [[left transiter of normal is characteristic]].

{{applyingoperatorgives|join-transiter|join-transitively 2-subnormal subgroup}}

A join-transitively 2-subnormal subgroup is a subgroup whose join with any 2-subnormal subgroup is 2-subnormal. Any [[normal subgroup]] is join-transitively 2-subnormal.

==Definition==

Suppose <math>G</math> is a [[finite group]] and <math>p</math> is a [[prime number]]. We say that <math>G</math> is a '''3-step group''' with respect to <math>p</math>:

# <math>O_{p,p'}(G)</math> is a [[Frobenius group]] with [[Frobenius kernel]] <math>O_p(G)</math> and cyclic complement of odd order. In particular, this means that either <math>p = 2</math> or <math>G</math> has odd order.
# <math>G = O_{p,p',p}(G)</math> and ''strictly'' contains <math>O_{p,p'}(G)</math>.
# <math>G/O_p(G)</math> is a [[Frobenius group]] with [[Frobenius kernel]] <math>O_{p,p'}(G)/O_p(G)</math>.

==Examples==

[[Symmetric group:S4]] is an example of a 3-step group with <math>p = 2</math>. If <math>G = S_4</math>, then:

* <math>O_p(G)</math> is the [[normal Klein four-subgroup of symmetric group:S4]], isomorphic to the [[Klein four-group]].

{{group property}}

==Definition==

A '''3-transposition group''' is defined as a [[group]] that is either [[trivial group|trivial]] or has a [[generating set]] that is a ''single'' [[conjugacy class]] whose elements are [[defining ingredient::3-transposition]]s, i.e., [[involution]]s such that the product of any of them with any conjugate has order 1, 2, or 3.

3-transposition groups were studied by Fischer. In addition to various infinite families, he identified a small number of them, called [[Fischer group]]s, that did not fall into the infinite families. This gave rise to three new [[sporadic simple group]]s.

A 4-subnormal subgroup of a 4-subnormal subgroup need not be 4-subnormal. This follows from the fact that there can be subgroups of arbitrarily large subnormal depth. {{proofat|[[There exist subgroups of arbitrarily large subnormal depth]]}}

==Metaproperties==

{{DP-closed}}

A direct product of A-groups is an A-group. This is because the Sylow subgroups of the direct product are the direct products of the individual Sylow subgroups.

{{S-closed}}

Any [[subgroup]] of an A-group is an A-group. This follows from the fact that a <math>p</math>-Sylow subgroup of a subgroup is a <math>p</math>-group in the whole group, and hence is contained in a <math>p</math>-Sylow subgroup of the whole group, which is Abelian. Hence, the <math>p</math>-Sylow subgroup of the subgroup is also Abelian.

{{Q-closed}}

Any quotient of an A-group is an A-group. This follows from the fact that under a quotient mapping, the image of a Sylow subgroup remains a Sylow subgroup.

Any AEP subgroup of an AEP subgroup is an AEP subgroup. This follows from the Automorphism Extension Property being a balanced subgroup property.

{{basicdef in|APS theory}}

{{group object|APS}}

{{wikilocal}}
==Definition==

An APS of groups is an [[APS]] over the category of groups. More specifically, an APS <math>(G,\Phi)</math> of groups is the following data:

* For each natural number <math>n</math>, a group, denoted <math>G_n</math>.
* For each ordered pair <math>(m,n)</math> of natural numbers, a homomorphism <math>\Phi_{m,n}:G_m \times G_n \to G_{m+n}</math>.

Satisfying  the following compatibility conditions:

For <math>g, h, k</math> in <math>G_m, G_n, G_p</math> respectively:

<math>\Phi_{m+n,p} (\Phi_{m,n}(g,h),k) = \Phi_{m,n+p} (g, \Phi_{n,p}(h,k))</math>.

The above condition is termed an associativity condition.

We may assume <math>G_0</math> as the trivial group and define <math>\Phi_{m,0}</math> and <math>\Phi_{0,n}</math> as trivial paddings.

==Terminology==

===Members and elements===

For an APS <math>(G,\Phi)</math> the member <math>G_n</math> is termed the <math>n^{th}</math> member of the APS. A '''member''' of the APS is an object that is the <math>n^{th}</math> member for some <math>n</math>.

An '''element''' of the APS is an element of some member of the APS.

The '''home''' of an element of the APS is the member in which it lies. The '''index''' of a member is the <math>n</math> for which it is the <math>n^{th}</math> member.

===Block concatenation map===

The maps <math>\Phi_{m,n}</math> are termed '''block concatenation maps'''.

===Ground member===

The ground member of an APS is its first member.

==Other notions==

===Homomorphism of APSes===

{{further|[[APS homomorphism]]}}

Given APSes <math>(G,\Phi)</math> and <math>(H,\Psi)</math>, a homomorphism <math>h: G</math> &rarr; <math>H</math> associates, to each natural number <math>n</math>, a map <math>h_n: G_n</math> &rarr; <math>H_n</math>, such that:

<math>\Psi_{m,n}(h_m(a),h_n(b)) = h_{m+n}(\Phi_{m,n}(a,b))</math>

===Sub-APS notion===

{{further|[[sub-APS]]}}

Given an APS <math>(G,\Phi)</math>, a sub-APS <math>H</math> associates, to each <math>n</math>, a subgroup <math>H_n</math> of <math>G_n</math>, such that the image of <math>H_m X H_n</math> under <math>\Phi_{m,n}</math> lies inside <math>H_{m+n}</math>.

When the APS of groups is injective, any sub-APS is also injective.

===Quotient APS notion===

{{further|[[quotient APS]]}}

A quotient APS is the image of an APS in a homomorphism that is surjective at each member.

===Normal sub-APSes, kernels and images===

Given a homomorphism of APSes of groups, the kernels of the individual homomorphisms for a sub-APS of the domain APS, and the images of the individual homomorphism form a sub-APS of the range APS.
The image is thus a quotient APS.

Further, we have the following result: a sub-APS of an APS of groups occurs as the kernel of an APS homomorphism if and only if every member of it is a normal subgroup of the corresponding member of the whole APS. A sub-APS satisfying either of these equivalent conditions is termed a [[normal sub-APS]].

This parallels the group theory result that a subgroup of a group occurs as the kernel of a group homomorphism if and only if it is normal.

==Properties==
===Injectivity===

An APS of groups is termed injective, or an [[IAPS of groups]], if every block concatenation map is injective. For an IAPS of groups, we usually also assume the condition of refinability.

===Commutativity===

Very few APSes of groups are commutative. Note that a commutative APS cannot also be injective.

===Padding-injectivity===

Most APSes of groups that we encounter satisfy the condition of being padding-injective.

==History==

===Origin of the term===

The term '''abelian group''' comes from Niels Henrick Abel, a mathematician who worked with groups even before the formal theory was laid down, in order to prove unsolvability of the quintic.

The word ''abelian'' is usually begun with a small ''a''.

{{quotation|'''wikinote''': Some older content on the wiki uses capital A for Abelian. We're trying to update this content.}} 

<section begin=beginner/>
==Definition==

An '''abelian group''' is a [[group]] where any two elements commute. In symbols, a [[group]] <math>G</math> is termed '''abelian''' if for any elements <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> in <math>G</math>, <math>xy = yx</math> (here <math>xy</math> denotes the product of <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> in <math>G</math>). Note that <math>x,y</math> are allowed to be equal, though equal elements commute anyway, so we can restrict attention if we wish to unequal elements.

<section end=beginner/>

===Full definition===

An '''abelian group''' is a set <math>G</math> equipped with a (infix) binary operation <math>+</math> (called the addition or group operation), an identity element <math>0</math> and a (prefix) unary operation <math>-</math>, called the inverse map or negation map, satisfying the following:

* For any <math>a,b,c \in G</math>, <math>a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c</math>. This property is termed [[associativity]].
* For any <math>a \in G</math>, <math>a + 0 = 0 + a = a</math>. <math>0</math> thus plays the role of an additive [[identity element]] or [[neutral element]].
* For any <math>a \in G</math>, <math>a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0</math>. Thus, <math>-a</math> is an [[inverse element]] to <math>a</math> with respect to <math>+</math>.
* For any <math>a,b \in G</math>, <math>a + b = b + a</math>. This property is termed [[commutativity]].

===Equivalent formulations===

A group <math>G</math> is termed abelian if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:

* Its [[defining ingredient::center]] <math>Z(G)</math> is the whole group.
* Its [[defining ingredient::derived subgroup]] <math>G' = [G,G]</math> is trivial.
* (Choose a generating set <math>S</math> for <math>G</math>). For any elements <math>a,b \in S</math>, <math>ab = ba</math>.
* The diagonal subgroup <math>\{ (g,g) \mid g \in G \}</math> is a [[defining ingredient::normal subgroup]] inside <math>G \times G</math>.
<section begin=beginner/>

==Notation==

When <math>G</math> is an abelian group, we typically use ''additive'' notation and terminology. Thus, the group multiplication is termed ''addition'' and the product of two elements is termed the ''sum''. 

# The infix operator <math>+</math> is used for the group multiplication, so the sum of two elements <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> is denoted by <math>a + b</math>. The group multiplication is termed ''addition'' and the product of two elements is termed the ''sum''. 
# The identity element is typically denoted as <math>0</math> and termed ''zero''
# The inverse of an element is termed its ''negative'' or ''additive inverse''. The inverse of <math>a</math> is denoted <math>-a</math>
# <math>a + a + \ldots + a</math> done <math>n</math> times is denoted <math>na</math>, (where <math>n \in \mathbb{N}</math>) while <math>(-a) + (-a) + (-a) + \ldots + (-a)</math> done <math>n</math> times is denoted <math>(-n)a</math>.

This convention is typically followed in a situation where we are dealing with the abelian group <math>G</math> in isolation, rather than as a subgroup of a possibly non-abelian group. If we are working with subgroups in a non-abelian group, we typically use multiplicative notation even if the subgroup happens to be abelian.

==Examples==

{{group property see examples}}

===Some infinite examples===

The additive group of integers <math>\mathbb{Z}</math>, the additive group of rational numbers <math>\mathbb{Q}</math>, the additive group of real numbers <math>\mathbb{R}</math>, the multiplicative group of nonzero rationals <math>\mathbb{Q}^*</math>, and the multiplicative group of nonzero real numbers <math>\mathbb{R}^*</math> are some examples of Abelian groups.

(More generally, for any field, the additive group, and the multiplicative group of nonzero elements, are Abelian groups).
<section end=beginner/>
<section begin=revisit/>
===Finite examples===
[[Cyclic group]]s are good examples of abelian groups, where the cyclic group of order <math>n</math> is the group of integers modulo <math>n</math>. 

Further, any direct product of cyclic groups is also an abelian group. Further, every [[finitely generated group|finitely generated]] Abelian group is obtained this way. This is the famous [[structure theorem for finitely generated abelian groups]].

The structure theorem can be used to generate a complete listing of finite abelian groups, as described here: [[classification of finite Abelian groups]].

===Non-examples===

Not every group is abelian. The smallest non-abelian group is [[symmetric group:S3|the symmetric group on three letters]]: the group of all permutations on three letters, under composition. Its being non-abelian hinges on the fact that the order in which permutations are performed matters.
<section end=revisit/>

==Facts==

===Occurrence as subgroups===

Every [[cyclic group]] is abelian. Since each group is generated by its cyclic subgroups, every group is generated by a family of abelian subgroups. A trickier question is: do there exist abelian [[normal subgroup]]s? A good candidate for an abelian normal subgroup is the [[center]], which is the collection of elements of the group that commute with ''every'' element of the group.

===Occurrence as quotients===

The maximal abelian quotient of any group is termed its [[abelianization]], and this is the quotient by the [[derived subgroup]]. A subgroup is an [[abelian-quotient subgroup]] (i.e., normal with abelian quotient group) if and only if the subgroup contains the derived subgroup.

* [[Supersolvable group]] is a group that has a [[normal series]] where all the successive quotient groups are [[cyclic group]]s. An abelian group is supersolvable if and only if it is [[finitely generated abelian group|finitely generated]].
* [[Polycyclic group]] is a group that has a [[subnormal series]] where all the successive quotent groups are [[cyclic group]]s. An abelian group is polycyclic if and only if it is finitely generated.

==Formalisms==

{{obtainedbyapplyingthe|diagonal-in-square operator|normal subgroup}}

A group <math>G</math> is an abelian group if and only if, in the [[external direct product]] <math>G \times G</math>, the diagonal subgroup <math>\{ (g,g) \mid g \in G \}</math> is a [[normal subgroup]].

==Testing==

===The testing problem===

{{further|[[Abelianness testing problem]]}}

The abelianness testing problem is the problem of testing whether a group (described using some [[group description rule]], such as an [[encoding of a group]] or a [[multi-encoding of a group]]) is abelian.

Algorithms for the abelianness testing problem range from the [[brute-force black-box group algorithm for abelianness testing]] (that involves testing for ''every'' pair of elements whether they commute, and is quadratic in the order of the group) to the [[generating set-based black-box group algorithm for abelianness testing]] (that involves testing only on a generating set, and is quadratic in the size of the generating set).

{{GAP command for gp|
test = IsAbelian|
class = AbelianGroups}}

To test whether a group is abelian, the GAP syntax is:

<tt>IsAbelian (group)</tt>

where <tt>group</tt> either defines the group or gives the name to a group previously defined.

===Related group properties===

The group property of not having any nontrivial abelian normal subgroup is equivalent to the property of being [[Fitting-free group|Fitting-free]] i.e. not having any nontrivial nilpotent normal subgroup.

==Facts==

* [[Quotient group acts on abelian normal subgroup]]: One of the main differences between Abelian normal subgroups and other normal subgroups is that for an Abelian normal subgroup, there is a well-defined action of the quotient group on the subgroup. This is the beginning of group cohomology, which essentially looks at the study of groups that have a given Abelian normal subgroup and a given quotient group, with a specified action of the quotient group on the subgroup.
* [[Degree of irreducible representation divides index of abelian normal subgroup]]: For a finite group, the degrees of irreducible representations over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero divide the index of any Abelian normal subgroup.
* [[Maximal among abelian normal implies self-centralizing in nilpotent]] and [[maximal among abelian normal implies self-centralizing in supersolvable]]: In a group that is nilpotent or supersolvable, any subgroup that is maximal among Abelian normal subgroups contains its own centralizer.

==Metaproperties==

{{intransitive}}

An abelian normal subgroup of an abelian normal subgroup need not be an abelian normal subgroup.
{{intsubcondn}}

If <math>H</math> is an abelian normal subgroup of <math>G</math>, <math>H</math> is also an abelian normal subgroup in any intermediate subgroup <math>K</math>. This follows from the fact that ''normality'' satisfies the same condition: [[Normality satisfies intermediate subgroup condition]].

{{imagecondn}}

The image of an sbelian normal subgroup under a surjective homomorphism is an Abelian normal subgroup of the image. This follows from two facts: [[Abelianness is quotient-closed]], and [[normality satisfies image condition]].

{{intersection-closed}}

An intersection of a nonempty collection of Abelian normal subgroups is again an Abelian normal subgroup. This follows from two facts: [[Abelianness is subgroup-closed]], and [[normality is strongly intersection-closed]].

{{not join-closed}}

A join of Abelian normal subgroups of a group need not be an Abelian normal subgroup. A join of finitely many Abelian normal subgroups, however, is guaranteed to be nilpotent. {{proofat|[[Abelian normal is not join-closed]]}}

==History==

===Origin===

{{term introduced by|Carter}}

The notion of abnormal subgroup was introduced by Roger W. Carter in his attempts to understand the structure of [[Carter subgroup]]s of a [[solvable group]].
==Definition==

===Definition with symbols===

A subgroup <math>H</math> of a group <math>G</math> is termed '''abnormal''' if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:
#
#* (''Right action convention''): For any <math>x</math> in <math>G</math>, <math>x</math> lies inside the subgroup <math>\langle H,H^x \rangle</math>. Here <math>H^x</math> denotes the [[conjugate subgroups|conjugate subgroup]] <math>x^{-1}Hx</math>.
#* (''Left action convention''): For any <math>x \in G</math>, we have <math>x \in \langle H, xHx^{-1} \rangle</math>.
# <math>H</math> is a [[defining ingredient::weakly abnormal subgroup]] of <math>G</math> and is not contained in the [[defining ingredient::intersection of two distinct conjugate subgroups]].

* [[Stronger than::Weakly pronormal subgroup]]
* [[Stronger than::Paranormal subgroup]]
* [[Stronger than::Polynormal subgroup]]
* [[Stronger than::Contranormal subgroup]]

===Opposites===

The only subgroup of a group that is both normal and abnormal is the whole group itself.

==Metaproperties==
{{intsubcondn}}

If <math>H</math> is abnormal inside <math>G</math>, <math>H</math> is also abnormal inside <math>K</math> for any intermediate subgroup <math>K</math>.

{{upward-closed}}

If <math>H</math> is abnormal inside <math>G</math>, then so is any subgroup <math>K</math> of <math>G</math> containing <math>H</math>.

{{intransitive}}

The property of being abnormal is ''not'' transitive. Its [[subordination]] is the property of being [[subabnormal subgroup|subabnormal]].

===Trimness===

The property of being abnormal is [[identity-true subgroup property|identity-true]], that is, any group is abnormal as a subgroup of itself. It is ''not'' true for the trivial subgroup unless the whole group is trivial.

==Testing==

{{GAP code for subgroup property|test = IsAbnormal}}

There's no in-built function to test for abnormality, but a short snippet of code can be used to test if a subgroup is abnormal. The function is invoked as follows:

<pre>IsAbnormal(group,subgroup);</pre>

===Definition with symbols===

{{group property}}
{{nottobeconfusedwith|[[algebraic group]] or [[group algebra]]}}
==Definition==

===General definition===

Let <math>N</math> be an associative algebra over a [[field]] <math>F</math> with the property that for any <math>x \in N</math>, there exists <math>y \in N</math> such that <math>x + y + xy = 0</math>. (in other words, <math>N</math> is a [[radical ring]]).

Then, the '''algebra group''' corresponding to <math>N</math> is the [[adjoint group]] of <math>N</math>, i.e., the group whose elements are formally:

<math>\{ 1 + x | x \in N\}</math>

where the multiplication is defined as:

<math>(1 + x)(1 + y) = 1 + (x + y + xy)</math>

There are two interpretations of this:

# We can think of the algebra group as living inside the unitization <math>N + F</math> as the coset of <math>N</math> for <math>1 \in F</math>.
# Alternatively, since there is a bijection between <math>N</math> and its algebra group, we can think of the algebra group as simply the set <math>N</math> with group operation <math>x * y := x + y +  xy</math>. This is based on the idea of the [[multiplicative formal group law]]. However, unlike other [[formal group law]]s, the multiplicative formal group law is valid even in ''non-commutative'' settings, and that is necessary for this definition.

===Nilpotent case===

If <math>N</math> is an associative algebra over a field <math>F</math> with the property that every element of <math>N</math> is nilpotent, then it is true that for any <math>x \in N</math>, there exists <math>y \in N</math> such that <math>x + y + xy = 0</math>. Thus, we can always define the algebra group corresponding to any such algebra <math>N</math>.

===Finite field case===

If <math>F</math> is a [[finite field]] and <math>N</math> is a finite-dimensional associative algebra over <math>F</math>, the following are equivalent:

# For any <math>x \in N</math>, there exists <math>y \in N</math> such that <math>x + y + xy = 0</math>.
# Every element of <math>N</math> is nilpotent.
# <math>N</math> is a nilpotent algebra, i.e., there is some fixed length such that all products of that length of elements in <math>N</math> equal zero.

Thus, for a finite-dimensional associative algebra over a finite field <math>F</math>, we talk of its algebra group only if it satisfies these equivalent conditions.

===In the context of an abstract group===

A [[group of prime power order]] which can be realized as an algebra group any [[finite field]] is termed an '''algebra group'''. Note that an algebra group over <math>\mathbb{F}_q</math>, where <math>q</math> is a power of a prime <math>p</math>, must also be an algebra group over the prime field <math>\mathbb{F}_p</math>. Thus, saying that a finite <math>p</math>-group is an algebra group is equivalent to saying that it is an algebra group over <math>\mathbb{F}_p</math>.

==Facts==

===Uniqueness and non-uniqueness of the algebra===

Note that the nilpotent associative algebra up to isomorphism determines the algebra group up to isomorphism. However, it is not ''a priori'' clear whether the group up to isomorphism determines the nilpotent associative algebra up to isomorphism. It turns out that it does not, but there are important restrictions on the structure of the algebra that can be deduced from the group structure.

* [[Non-isomorphic nilpotent associative algebras may have isomorphic algebra groups]]
* [[Powering map by field characteristic is same in algebra and algebra group]]
* [[Lazard Lie ring of adjoint group of a radical ring equals associated Lie ring of the radical ring under suitable nilpotency assumptions]]

===Necessary conditions for being an algebra group===

Given a [[finite p-group]], it is not necessarily an [[algebra group]] over <math>\mathbb{F}_p</math>. Below are some things we can deduce if it is an algebra group:

* [[Algebra group is isomorphic to algebra subgroup of unitriangular matrix group of degree one more than logarithm of order to base of field size]]: Note that this gives a complete characterization of algebra groups, at least in the finite case. What it says is that any algebra group over <math>\mathbb{F}_q</math> of order <math>q^m</math> is isomorphic to an [[algebra subgroup]] of the [[unitriangular matrix group]] <math>UT(m+1,q)</math>.
* [[Algebra group implies power degree group for field size]]

{{group property}}

==Definition==

A [[group]] is termed an '''almost quasisimple group''' if it has a [[self-centralizing normal subgroup]] that is a [[quasisimple group]].

Note that for such a group, the self-centralizing quasisimple normal subgroup is unique (and hence also a [[characteristic subgroup]]) and is also the only [[component]] of the group, hence also equals the [[commuting product]] and the [[generalized Fitting subgroup]] of the group.

==Definition==

===Symbol-free definition===

A [[group]] is said to be '''almost simple''' if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:

* There is a [[simple non-abelian group]] such that the given group can be embedded between the simple group and its automorphism group.
* The group has a [[centralizer-free subgroup|centralizer-free]] non-abelian [[simple normal subgroup]].
===Definition with symbols===

A [[group]] <math>G</math> is said to be '''almost simple''' if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:

* There is a [[simple group|simple]] non-abelian group <math>S</math> such that <math>S \le T \le \operatorname{Aut}(S)</math> for some group <math>T</math> isomorphic to <math>G</math>.
* There exists a normal subgroup <math>N</math> of <math>G</math> such that <math>N</math> is a simple non-abelian group and <math>C_G(N)</math> is trivial.

==Definition==

===For a finite set===

Let <math>S</math> be a finite set. The '''alternating group''' on <math>S</math> is defined in the following equivalent ways:

# It is the group of all [[defining ingredient::even permutation]]s on <math>S</math> under composition. An even permutation is a permutation whose cycle decomposition has an even number of cycles of even size. Specifically, the alternating group on <math>S</math> is the subgroup of the [[defining ingredient::symmetric group]] on <math>S</math> comprising the even permutations.
# It is the kernel of the [[sign homomorphism]] from the symmetric group on <math>S</math> to the group <math>\pm 1</math>.

For <math>S</math> having size zero or one, the alternating group on <math>S</math> equals the whole symmetric group on <math>S</math>. For <math>S</math> having size at least two, the alternating group on <math>S</math> is the unique subgroup of index two in the symmetric group on <math>S</math>.

The alternating group on a set of size <math>n</math> is denoted <math>A_n</math> and is termed the alternating group of degree <math>n</math>.

===For an infinite set===

Let <math>S</math> be an infinite set. The '''finitary alternating group''' on <math>S</math> is defined in the following equivalent ways:

# It is the group of all even permutations on <math>S</math> under composition.
# It is the kernel of the [[sign homomorphism]] on the [[finitary symmetric group]] on <math>S</math>.

==Facts==

* The alternating group on a set of size five or more is simple. Also, the finitary alternating group on an infinite set is simple. {{proofat|[[A5 is simple]], [[alternating groups are simple]]}}
* [[Projective special linear group equals alternating group in only finitely many cases]]

==Arithmetic functions==

Here, <math>n</math> is the degree of the alternating group, i.e., the size of the set it acts on.

For all the statements involving <math>n \ge 5</math>, we use the fact that [[A5 is simple]] and [[alternating groups are simple]] for degree at least five.

==Endomorphisms==

===Automorphisms===

The automorphism group of the alternating group of degree four is isomorphic to the symmetric group of degree four. Since the alternating group of degree four is centerless, it embeds as a subgroup inside its automorphism group.

Another way of thinking of this is as follows: in the symmetric group of degree four, the alternating group of degree four is a subgroup of index two, and every automorphism of this subgroup is realized as the restriction to this subgroup of an inner automorphism of the symmetric group.

===Endomorphisms===

The endomorphisms of the alternating group of degree four are given by the following (i.e., equivalent to one of these up to composition with an automorphism):

* The trivial map.
* The identity map.
* The retraction to a subgroup of order three, with kernel being the [[Klein four-group]] comprising the identity and the double transpositions. (All such retractions are equivalent).

===Summary===

{{#lst:element structure of alternating group:A4|summary}}

===Up to conjugacy===

{{#lst:element structure of alternating group:A4|conjugacy class structure}}

===Up to automorphism===

The conjugacy classes of the identity element and double transpositions are invariant under all automorphisms.

An outer automorphism interchanges the conjugacy classes of elements of order three (each of size four). This can be realized, for instance, by viewing the alternating group as a subgroup of the [[symmetric group:S4|symmetric group of degree four]]. Any [[transposition]] or <math>4</math>-cycle in the symmetric group interchanges those two conjugacy classes

==Endomorphisms==

===Automorphisms===

The automorphism group of <math>A_5</math> is the [[symmetric group:S5|symmetric group on five letters]] <math>S_5</math>, with <math>A_5</math> embedded in it as inner automorphisms.

Concretely, we can think of <math>A_5</math> as embedded in <math>S_5</math>, and <math>S_5</math> acting on <math>A_5</math> by conjugation. The automorphisms obtained this way are all the automorphisms of <math>A_5</math>.

===Other endomorphisms===

Since <math>A_5</math> is a finite simple group, it is a [[group in which every endomorphism is trivial or an automorphism]]. In particular, the endomorphisms of <math>A_5</math> are: the trivial map, and the automorphisms described above.

[[importance rank::3| ]]
==Definition==

This group is defined in the following equivalent ways:

# It is the [[member of family::alternating group]] of degree eight, i.e., over a set of size eight.
# It is the [[member of family::projective special linear group]] of degree four over the [[field:F2|field of two elements]], i.e., <math>PSL(4,2)</math>. It is also the [[member of family::special linear group]] <math>SL(4,2)</math>, the [[member of family::projective general linear group]] <math>PGL(4,2)</math>, and the [[member of family::general linear group]] <math>GL(4,2)</math>.

This is one member of the smallest order pair of non-isomorphic finite simple non-abelian groups having the same order. The other member of this pair is [[projective special linear group:PSL(3,4)]].

===Equivalence of definitions===

The equivalence between the various definitions ''within'' (2) follows from [[isomorphism between linear groups over field:F2]].

==Definition==

===Definition with symbols===

Suppose <math>G</math> is a [[group]] and <math>H</math> is a [[subgroup]] of <math>G</math>. We say that <math>H</math> is an '''amalgam-characteristic subgroup''' of <math>G</math> if <math>H</math> is characteristic in the group <math>L</math> given by:

<math>L = G *_H G</math>.

In other words, <math>L</math> is the [[amalgam]] of <math>G</math> with itself over <math>H</math>, and <math>H</math> is treated as the subgroup of <math>L</math> given by the amalgamated <math>H</math> between the two factors.

{{group property}}
{{termrelatedto|linear representation theory}}

==Definition==

===Symbol-free definition===

A [[group]] is said to be '''ambivalent''' if every element in it is [[defining ingredient::conjugate elements|conjugat]]e to its inverse.

For a finite group,this is equivalent to saying that every character of the group over complex numbers, is real-valued.

An element in a group that is conjugate to its inverse is termed a [[defining ingredient::real element]]. Thus, a group is ambivalent if and only if all its elements are real elements.

===Definition with symbols===

A [[group]] <math>G</math> is said to be '''ambivalent''' if, for any <math>g \in G</math>, there exists <math>h \in G</math> such that <math>hgh^{-1} = g^{-1}</math>.

For a finite group <math>G</math>, this is equivalent to saying that any representation <math>\rho:G \to GL_n(\mathbb{C})</math> with character <math>\chi</math>, <math>\chi(g)\in \mathbb{R}</math> for all <math>g \in G</math>.

==Examples==

===Extreme examples===

* The [[trivial group]] is ambivalent.

===Important families of groups===

* [[Symmetric groups are ambivalent]]: All the symmetric groups are ambivalent.
* [[Classification of ambivalent alternating groups]]: The alternating group of degree <math>n</math> is ambivalent only if <math>n \in \{ 1,2,5,6,10,14 \}</math>.

{{group property}}

==Definition==

A [[discrete group]] <math>G</math> is termed an '''amenable discrete group''' if there exists a function that assigns to each subset of <math>G</math> a real number in <math>[0,1]</math> such that:

* The number associated with the whole of <math>G</math> is <math>1</math>
* The function is finitely additive on subsets. In other words, the number associated with a disjoint union of finitely many subsets is the sum of the numbers associated with each of the subsets
* The function is left-invariant, viz., the value associated with a subset <math>S</math> is the same as the value associated with <math>gS</math>

Often, when dealing with an abstract [[group]], we use the term '''amenable group''' for amenable discrete group (in other words, we assume that the discrete topology is put over the group).

==Definition==

===Definition with symbols===

Let <math>G</math> be a [[group]] and <math>g \in G</math> be an element. Then, the '''approximate normalizer''' of <math>g</math>, denoted as <math>N_G^*(g)</math> is defined as the set of all elements <math>t \in G</math> for which there exist nonzero integers <math>m,n</math> such that <math>t^{-1}g^mt = g^n</math>.

The approximate normalizer of any element is a subgroup of the whole group. It equals the whole group if the element has finite order (viz, is a torsion element). Thus, the notion makes sense to study only for elements of infinite order.

A [[subgroup]] <math>H</math> of a [[group]] <math>G</math> is termed '''ascendant''' if we have subgroups <math>H_\alpha</math> of <math>G</math> for every ordinal <math>\alpha</math> such that:

* <math>H_0 = H</math>
* <math>H_\alpha \ \underline{\triangleleft} \ H_{\alpha + 1}</math> (viz <math>H_\alpha</math> is a [[normal subgroup]] of <math>H_{\alpha + 1}</math>) for every ordinal <math>\alpha</math>.
* If <math>\alpha</math> is a limit ordinal, then <math>H_\alpha = \bigcup_{\gamma < \alpha} H_\gamma</math>, i.e., it is the union of all preceding subgroups. Note that the union of any ascending chain of subgroups is indeed a sugbroup (in fact, more generally, [[directed union of subgroups is subgroup]]). We can also define <math>H_{\alpha}</math>as <math>\langle H_\gamma \rangle_{\gamma < \alpha}</math>, i.e., it is the [[join of subgroups|join]] of all preceding subgroups.

and such that there is some ordinal <math>\beta</math> such that <math>H_\beta = G</math>.

===In terms of the ascendant closure operator===

The [[subgroup property]] of being an ascendant subgroup is obtained by applying the [[ascendant closure]] operator to the subgroup property of being [[normal subgroup|normal]].

==Definition==

Let <math>G</math> be a [[group]] and consider:

<math>1 = K_0 \triangleleft K_1 \triangleleft \ldots \triangleleft K_n = G</math>

a [[subnormal series]] for <math>G</math>. The '''associated direct sum''' for this series is the abstract group:

<math>\bigoplus_{i=0}^{n-1} K_{i+1}/K_i</math>

(direct sum here means the same thing as [[direct product]]).

==Facts==

===Automorphisms===

* Every [[automorphism of a subgroup series|automorphism]] of the subnormal series defines an automorphism of the associated direct sum. Thus, there is a homomorphism from the automorphism group of the subnormal series, to the automorphism group of the associated direct sum. The kernel of this homomorphism is termed the [[stability group of a subnormal series|stability group]].
* If the subnormal series is a [[normal series]], then every [[inner automorphism]] becomes an automorphism of the subgroup series, and hence gives rise to an automorphism of the direct sum.
* If the subnormal series is a [[central series]], then every inner automorphism is a stability automorphism of the subgroup series, and hence gives rise to the identity map on the direct sum.
* If the subnormal series is a [[characteristic series]], then every automorphism of the group is an automorphism of the subgroup series, hence we have a map from the [[automorphism group]] of the whole group to the automorphism group of the associated direct sum.

===Additional structure===

When the subgroup series is a [[strongly central series]], the associated direct sum acquires the structure of a [[Lie ring]].

==Definition==

===Definition with symbols===

A [[subgroup property]] <math>p</math> is termed an '''auto-invariance property''' if there is a [[group-closed automorphism property]] <math>q</math> such that for any subgroup <math>H \le G</math>, <math>H</math> has property <math>p</math> in <math>G</math>, iff any automorphism of <math>G</math> satisfying property <math>p</math>, sends <math>H</math> to within itself.

===In terms of the function restriction formalism===

A [[subgroup property]] <math>p</math> is termed an '''auto-invariance property''' if there is a [[group-closed automorphism property]] <math>q</math>, such that we can write the following [[function restriction expression]] for <math>p</math>:

<math>p = q \to </math> Function

In other words, a subgroup has subgroup property <math>p</math> if every automorphism with property <math>q</math>, for the whole group, restricts to a function from the subgroup to itself.

This is equivalent to the following function restriction expressions:

<math>p = q \to </math> Automorphism

and:

<math>p = q \to </math> Endomorphism

In other words, the restriction is automatically guaranteed to be an automorphism of the subgroup.

===Equivalence of definitions===

The equivalence of definitions follows from the elementary observation: [[restriction of automorphism to subgroup invariant under it and its inverse is automorphism]].

==Examples==

===Normal subgroups===

{{further|[[normal subgroup]]}}

The property of normality is an auto-invariance property, where the group-closed automorphism property in question is the property of being an [[inner automorphism]].

===Characteristic subgroups===

{{further|[[characteristic subgroup]]}}

The property of being characteristic is an auto-invariance property, where the group-closed automorphism property in question is the property of being ''any'' [[automorphism]].

==Definition==

===As an invariance property===
A [[subgroup]] <math>H</math> of a [[group]] <math>G</math> is termed an '''autoclinism-invariant subgroup''' if it is invariant under any bijective set map <math>\sigma:G \to G</math> satisfying all three of these conditions:

* <math>\sigma</math> induces an automorphism modulo the center, i.e., <math>\sigma(xy) = \sigma(x)\sigma(y)</math> mod <math>Z(G)</math>.
* <math>\sigma</math> restricts to an automorphism on the derived subgroup, i.e., <math>\sigma</matH> sends the derived subgroup to itself and the restriction to the derived subgroup is an automorphism of the derived subgroup.
* <math>\sigma([x,y]) = [\sigma(x),\sigma(y)]</math> for all (possibly equal, possibly distinct) <math>x,y \in G</math>.

===As a two-case property===

A [[subgroup]] <math>H</math> of a [[group]] <math>G</math> is termed an '''autoclinism-invariant subgroup''' if it satisfies ''either'' of these conditions:

# <math>H</math> contains the [[center]] <math>Z(G)</math> and <math>H/Z(G)</math> is invariant under any automorphism of <math>G/Z(G)</math> that is the inner automorphism group part of the data specifying an [[autoclinism]].
# <math>H</math> is contained in the [[derived subgroup]] <math>[G,G]</math> and it is invariant under any automorphism of <math>[G,G]</math> that is the derived subgroup part of the data specifying an [[autoclinism]].

{{subgroup property}}
{{wikilocal}}

==Examples==

* Every group is autoclinism-invariant in itself.
* The trivial subgroup is autoclinism-invariant in any group.
* All members of the [[upper central series]] and all members of the [[lower central series]] are autoclinism-invariant.
* For [[finite p-group]]s, the [[ZJ-subgroup]] and [[D*-subgroup]] are autoclinism-invariant.

==Definition==

An '''automatic group''' is a [[finitely generated group]] satisfying the following equivalent conditions:

# There exists a finite [[generating set]] with respect to which the group possesses an [[defining ingredient::automatic structure]].
# For every finite [[generating set]], the group possesses an [[automatic structure]] with respect to that generating set.

===Equivalence of definitions===

The equivalence of definitions (1) and (2) follows [[Frattini's argument]].

For the equivalence of definitions (1) and (3):

* (1) implies (3) is clear.
* For (3) implies (1), we essentially use that the subgroup of inner automorphisms is normal in the subgroup of automorphisms. {{further|[[Automorph-conjugate iff conjugate to image under a generating set of automorphism group]]}}

{{subgroup property}}
{{variation of|characteristic subgroup}}

==History==

This subgroup property was studied somewhat by [[Wielandt]], who dubbed them '''intravariant subgroup'''s.


==Formalisms==
{{wikilocal-section}}
{{riexp}}
The [[subgroup property]] of being automorph-conjugate can be expressed as [[automorphic subgroups]] <math>\implies</math> [[conjugate subgroups]]. In other words, <math>H</math> is automorph-conjugate in <math>G</math> iff for every automorph <math>K</math> of <math>H</math>, <math>H</math> and <math>K</math> are [[conjugate subgroups]].

==Examples==

===Extreme examples===

* The trivial subgroup in any group is an automorph-conjugate subgroup.
* Every group is automorph-conjugate as a subgroup of itself.

More generally, any [[characteristic subgroup]] of a group is automorph-conjugate.

===High-occurrence examples===

* In a [[cyclic group]], every subgroup is characteristic, and hence, every subgroup is automorph-conjugate.
* [[Group in which every subgroup is automorph-conjugate]]: In a [[complete group]], or more generally in a [[group in which every automorphism is inner]], ''every'' subgroup is automorph-conjugate. Examples include the symmetric groups of degree <math>n</math>, <math>n \ne 6</math>. {{further|[[Symmetric groups are complete]]}}

===Low-occurrence examples===

* In an [[abelian group]], and more generally, in a [[Dedekind group]], every subgroup is [[normal subgroup|normal]], and hence, every automorph-conjugate subgroup is characteristic.
* [[Group in which every automorph-conjugate subgroup is characteristic]]: Many groups occurring in practice have this property. For instance, any group occurring as a [[Frattini-embedded normal subgroup]] in a bigger group. {{further|[[Frattini-embedded normal-realizable implies ACIC]]}}

===Miscellaneous examples===

* [[Sylow subgroup]]s in [[finite group]]s are automorph-conjugate. {{further|[[Sylow implies automorph-conjugate]]}}
* In a free group on two generators, the cyclic subgroup generated by the commutator of the two generators is automorph-conjugate. {{further|[[Subgroup generated by commutator of generators of free group on two generators is automorph-conjugate]]}}

==Definition==

A [[subgroup]] <math>H</math> of a [[group]] <math>G</math> is termed an '''automorph-dominating subgroup''' if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:

# For any [[automorphism]] <math>\sigma</math> of <math>G</math>, there exists <math>g \in G</math> such that the [[automorphic subgroups|automorph]] <math>\sigma(H)</math> is contained in the [[conjugate subgroups|conjugate subgroup]] <math>gHg^{-1}</math>.

Note that the <math>w</math> for version (2) may not equal the <math>g</math> for version (1).

Note that if <math>H</math> is a [[co-Hopfian group]] (i.e. it does not contain any proper subgroup isomorphic to it) this property is equivalent to being an [[automorph-conjugate subgroup]].

==Definition==

===Symbol-free definition===

The '''automorphism group''' of a [[group]] is defined as a group whose elements are all the [[automorphism of a group|automorphism]]s of the base group, and where the group operation is composition of automorphisms. In other words, it gets a group structure as a subgroup of the group of all permutations of the group.

===Definition with symbols===

The '''automorphism group''' of a [[group]] <math>G</math>, denoted <math>\operatorname{Aut}(G)</math>, is a set whose elements are automorphisms <math>\sigma:G \to G</math>, and where the group multiplication is composition of automorphisms. In other words, its group structure is obtained as a subgroup of <math>\operatorname{Sym}(G)</math>, the group of all permutations on <math>G</math>.

==Subgroups==

Every [[group-closed automorphism property]] gives rise to a [[normal subgroup]] of the automorphism group. Some of the most important examples are given below:

{| class="sortable" border="1"
! Group-closed automorphism property !! Meaning !! Corresponding normal subgroup of the automorphism group
|-
| [[inner automorphism]] || can be expressed as [[conjugation]] by an element of the group, i.e., there exists <math>g \in G</math> such that the map has the form <math>x \mapsto gxg^{-1}</math> || it is called the [[inner automorphism group]] and is isomorphic to the [[quotient group]] <math>G/Z(G)</math> where <math>Z(G)</math> is the [[center]]. See [[group acts as automorphisms by conjugation]].

|-
| [[monomial automorphism]] || can be expressed using a monomial formula || the momomial automorphism group
|-
| [[normal automorphism]] || sends every normal subgroup to itself || the normal automorphism group
|}

==Facts==

* [[Extensible equals inner]]: An automorphism of a group has the property that it can be extended to an automorphism for any bigger group containing it if and only if the automorphism is an [[inner automorphism]].
* [[Quotient-pullbackable equals inner]]: An automorphism of a group has the property that it can be pulled back to an automorphism for any group admitting it as a quotient, if and only if the automorphism is an inner automorphism.

==Definition==

This group is defined in the following equivalent ways:

# It is the [[defining ingredient::automorphism group]] of [[defining ingredient::alternating group:A6]].
# It is the [[defining ingredient::automorphism group]] of [[defining ingredient::symmetric group:S6]].
# It is the [[member of family::projective semilinear group]] of [[member of family::projective semilinear group of degree two|degree two]] over [[field:F9|the field of nine elements]], i.e., it is the group <math>P\Gamma L(2,9)</math>.

Note that for any <math>n \ne 2,3,6</math>, the [[automorphism group]] of the alternating group <math>A_n</math> is precisely the symmetric group <math>S_n</math>, which is a [[complete group]]. The case <math>n = 2</math> is uninteresting.

The case <math>n = 6</math> is the only case where the automorphism group of the alternating group is strictly ''bigger'' than the symmetric group.  Similarly, it is the only case where the automorphism group of the symmetric group is strictly ''bigger'' than the symmetric group. {{further|[[symmetric groups on finite sets are complete]]}}

{{particular group}}

==Definition==

This group is defined as the [[automorphism group]] of [[free group:F2]] -- the free group of rank two.

{{under development but get information from|automorphism group of a finitely generated free group}}

https://groupprops.subwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Automorphism_group_of_free_group:F2&action=edit

{{basicdef}}

{{function property}}

''Automorphism redirects here. For more general notions of automorphism, refer [[automorphism of a universal algebra]] and [[automorphism of a structure]]''

==Definition==

===Symbol-free definition===

An '''automorphism''' of a [[group]] is any of the following equivalent things:

* An [[isomorphism of groups|isomorphism]] from the group to itself
* A bijective [[endomorphism of a group|endomorphism]] of the group
* A [[homomorphism of groups|homomorphism]] that is both an endomorphism and an isomorphism

===Definition with symbols===

Let <math>G</math> be a [[group]]. A map <math>\sigma</math> from <math>G</math> to itself is termed an '''automorphism''' of <math>G</math> if it satisfies all of the following conditions:

* <math>\sigma</math> is bijective
* <math>\sigma(gh) = \sigma(g)\sigma(h)</math> whenever <math>g</math> and <math>h</math> are both in <math>G</math>
* <math>\sigma(e) = e</math>
* <math>\sigma(g^{-1}) = \sigma(g)^{-1}</math>

Actually, the third and fourth condition follow from the first two (refer [[equivalence of definitions of group homomorphism]]).

==Relation with other properties==

===Stronger properties===

These are properties of (function from a group to itself) that are stronger than the property of being an automorphism:

* [[Inner automorphism]]: An automorphism that arises as conjugation via an element of the group
* [[Power automorphism]]: An automorphism that maps each element to a power of itself

===Weaker properties===

These are properties of (function from a group to itself) that that are weaker than the property of being an automorphism, viz function properties that are satisfied by every automorphism:

* [[Injective endomorphism]]
* [[Surjective endomorphism]]
* [[Endomorphism]]
* [[Semiautomorphism]]
* [[Quasiautomorphism]]

==Facts==

===Composition===

The composite of two automorphisms of a group is again an automorphism of the group. This follows from the fact that the composite of any two isomorphisms is an isomorphism.

===Inverse===

The inverse of any automorphism is an automorphism.

===Identity map===

The [[identity map]] is always an automorphism.

===Group structure===

Combining the fact that automorphisms are closed under composition, inverse and contain the identity map, the automorphisms of a group form a subgroup of the monoid of all fucntions from the group to itself. This subgroup is termed the [[automorphism group]] of the given group.

==Property theory==

===Inner automorphisms===

{{further|[[inner automorphism]]}}

There is a natural [[homomorphism of groups|homomorphism]] from any group to its automorphism group, that sends each element of the group to the [[conjugation map]] by that element. The image of the group under this map is termed the [[inner automorphism group]], and automorphisms arising as such images are termed [[inner automorphism]]s.

==Related subgroup properties==

===Characteristic subgroup===

{{further|[[characteristic subgroup]]}}

A [[subgroup]] of a [[group]] is said to be [[characteristic subgroup|characteristic]] if every [[automorphism]] of the group maps it to itself.

Characteristic subgroups are thus the '''automorphism-invariant subgroups''' (the [[invariance property]] for automorphisms)and the property of being characteristic is stronger than the property of being [[normal subgroup|normal]], which is just invariance under [[inner automorphism]]s. Characteristic subgroups also arise naturally as images of subgroup-defining functions.

===Automorphs===

Two [[subgroup]]s of a group are said to be [[automorph]]s if there is an automorphism of the whole group that maps one subgroup to the other. Clearly, for a [[characteristic subgroup]], it has no automorph other than itself. Subgroups which are automorphs are equivalent in all respects.

[[Conjugate subgroups]] are automatically automorphs, because every [[inner automorphism]] is also an [[automorphism]].

{{S-closed}}

Any subgroup of a BFC-group is a BFC-group. In fact, any subgroup of a <math>d</math>-BFC group is a <math>d</math>-BFC group. This follows from the fact that if two elements in the subgroup are conjugate in the subgroup, they are conjugate in the whole group. Hence, any conjugacy class in the subgroup is contained in  a conjugacy class in the whole group.

{{DP-closed}}

A direct product of BFC-groups is a BFC-group. In fact, a direct product of a <math>d_1</math>-BFC-group and a <math>d_2</math>-BFC-group is a <math>d_1d_2</math>-BFC-group. This follows from the fact that if two elements in the direct product of <math>G_1</math> and <math>G_2</math> are conjugate, then their <math>G_1</math>-coordinates are conjugate and their <math>G_2</math>-coordinates are conjugate. Hence, conjugacy classes in <math>G_1 \times G_2</math> are simply the pairwise direct products of conjugacy classes in <math>G_1</math> and <math>G_2</math>.

A '''Baer Lie group''' is a [[group]] <math>G</math> satisfying the following two conditions:

# It is a [[defining ingredient::nilpotent group]] of [[defining ingredient::group of nilpotency class two|class two]], i.e., its [[defining ingredient::nilpotency class]] is at most two.
# It is a [[defining ingredient::2-powered group]] (also known as uniquely 2-divisible group): For every <math>g \in G</math>, there is a unique element <math>h \in G</math> such that <math>h^2 = g</math>.

Given condition (1), condition (2) is equivalent to requiring that <math>G</math> be both [[2-torsion-free group|2-torsion-free]] (i.e., no element of order two) and [[2-divisible group|2-divisible]]. (see [[equivalence of definitions of nilpotent group that is torsion-free for a set of primes]]).

A Baer Lie group is a group that can serve on the group side of a [[Baer correspondence]], i.e., it has a corresponding [[Baer Lie ring]].

A finite group is a Baer Lie group if and only if it is an [[odd-order class two group]].

A [[group]] <math>G</math> is termed a '''Baer group''' if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:

==Definition==

===Symbol-free definition===

The '''Baer norm''' of a [[group]] is defined in the following equivalent ways:

* It is the intersection of [[normalizer]]s of all its [[subgroup]]s
* It is the intersection of normalizers of all [[cyclic group|cyclic]] subgroups.
* It is the set of those elements of the group for which the corresponding conjugation is a [[power automorphism]].

===Definition with symbols===

The '''Baer norm''' of a [[group]] <math>G</math> is defined as the intersection, over all subgroups <math>H</math> of <math>G</math> of the groups <math>N_G(H)</math>.

{{obtainedbyapplyingthe|intersect-all operator|normalizer subgroup}}

==Group properties==

The Baer norm is a [[Dedekind group]], i.e., it is a group in which every subgroup is [[normal subgroup|normal]]. Conversely, every Dedekind group equals its own Baer norm.

==Examples==

===Dedekind groups===

A [[Dedekind group]] is a group in which every subgroup is normal, or equivalently, a group that equals its own Baer norm. The finite Dedekind groups are precisely the following: 
* [[finite abelian group]]s
* [[finite nilpotent group]]s whose 2-Sylow subgroup is a product of the [[quaternion group]] of order eight and an [[elementary abelian group]], and all other Sylow subgroups are abelian.

The smallest examples of Dedekind non-abelian groups are [[quaternion group]] and [[direct product of Q8 and Z2]].

==Subgroup-defining function properties==

===Reverse monotonicity===

The Baer norm [[subgroup-defining function]] is weakly reverse monotone, that is, if <math>K</math> is a subgroup of <math>G</math> containing the Baer norm of <math>G</math>, then the Baer norm of <math>K</math> contains the Baer norm of <math>H</math>.

===Idempotence and iteration===

The Baer norm of a group equals its own Baer norm. A group equals its own Baer norm if and only if it is a [[Dedekind group]], that is, every subgroup in it is [[normal subgroup|normal]].

===Quotient-idempotence and quotient-iteration===

The quotient function corresponding to the Baer norm is ''not'' transitive.

==Definition==

===Symbol-free definition===

A [[subgroup property]] is said to be a '''balanced subgroup property''' if it can be expressed via a [[function restriction expression]] with both the ''left side'' and the ''right side'' being equal.

===Definition with symbols===

A [[subgroup property]] is said to be a '''balanced subgroup property''' if it can be expressed as <math>a \to a</math> where <math>a</math> is a function property. In other words, a subgroup <math>H</math> satisfies the property in a group <math>G</math> if and only if every function on <math>G</math> satisfying property <math>a</math> in <math>G</math> restricts to a function satisfying property <math>a</math> on <math>H</math>.

==Examples==

===Characteristic subgroup===

The property of a subgroup being [[characteristic subgroup|characteristic]] is expressible as a balanaced subgroup property in the function restriction formalism as follows:

Automorphism <math>\to</math> Automorphism

===Other examples===

* [[Fully characteristic subgroup]] = [[Endomorphism]] <math>\to</math> endomorphism
* [[Injective endomorphism-invariant subgroup]] = Injective endomorphism <math>\to</math> injective endomorphism

* [[Conjugacy-closed normal subgroup]] = [[Class automorphism]] <math>\to</math> Class automorphism
* [[Central factor]] = [[Inner automorphism]] <math>\to</math> inner automorphism

==Relation with other metaproperties==

===T.i. subgroup properties===

Clearly, any balanced subgroup property with respect to the function restriction formalism is both [[transitive subgroup property|transitive]] and [[identity-true subgroup property|identity-true]]. Hence, it is a [[t.i. subgroup property]].

Interestingly, a partial converse holds by the [[balance theorem]]: every t.i. subgroup property that can be expressed using the function restriction formalism, is actually a balanced subgroup property. In fact, more strongly, a balanced expression for the property can be obtained by using either the [[right tightening operator]] or the [[left tightening operator]] to any starting expression.

===Intersection-closedness===

In general, a balanced subgroup property need not be intersection-closed.

===Join-closedness===

In general, a balanced subgroup property need not be join-closed.

==Definition==

The term '''basic Lie product''' is used in the following context. Let <math>A</math> be the free associative algebra over the [[field of rational numbers]] <math>\mathbb{Q}</math> using <math>n</math> generators <math>x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n</math>. In other words, <math>A = \mathbb{Q} \langle x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n \rangle</math>.

The term '''basic Lie product''' is used for some of the iterated Lie products involving the variables <math>x_i</math>. There are two versions of the definition, one relying on left-normed commutators, and the other relying on right-normed commutators. Note that the basic commutators for the left-normed definition are not, in general, left-normed commutators. Similarly for the right-normed case.

===Left-normed definition===

The definition has a number of preliminaries, which we first attend to:

{| class="sortable" border="1"
! Term !! Meaning
|-
| lexicographic ordering on associative monomials || We define it as follows: <math>x_{i_1}x_{i_2} \dots x_{i_m} < x_{j_1}x_{j_2} \dots x_{j_n}</math> either if, for some <math>k</math>, we have <math>i_1 = j_1, i_2 = j_2, \dots i_{k-1} = j_{k-1}</math> and <math>i_k < j_k</math>, or if the right side is an initial segment of the left side.
|-
| regular word (also called ''Lyndon word'') || A word that is ''strictly'' greater than all its cyclic permutations. A word <math>u</math> is regular if, whenever <math>u = vw</math> for non-empty words <math>v,w</math>, then <math>u > wv</math>.
|-
| weight of a Lie product || the number of monomial terms that appear in it. Includes repetition counts. Thus, the weight of <math>[[x_1,x_2],[x_1,x_3]]</math> is 4.
|-
| underlying associative monomial of a Lie product || the monomial word obtained by dropping all the Lie brackets and reading the word as an associative word. Note that this is ''not'' the same as the element of <math>A</math> that one would get by expanding the Lie brackets. However, it is ''one'' of the monomials that occurs in that word. For instance, the underlying associative monomial of <math>[[x_1,x_2],x_3]</math> is <math>x_1x_2x_3</math>, whereas the polynomial for the Lie product itself is <math>x_1x_2x_3 - x_2x_1x_3 - x_3x_1x_2 + x_3x_2x_1</math>.
|}

Consider a Lie product <math>w</math> involving the generators <math>x_i</math>. It is termed a '''basic Lie product''' if ''either'' it has weight one or it satisfies '''all''' of the following conditions, after we first note <math>w = [u,v]</math> for smaller Lie products <math>u,v</math>:

# Both <math>u</math> and <math>v</math> are basic Lie products.
# The underlying associative monomial of <math>u</math> is greater than the underlying associative monomial of <math>v</math> in the lexicographic ordering (see above).
# If <math>u</math> has weight more than one, note it of the form <math>[u_1,u_2]</math>, and then it must be true that the underlying associative monomial of <math>u_2</math> is <math>\le</math> the underlying associative monomial of <math>v</math>. (''Note: If <math>u</math> has weight one, this condition need not be checked'').

The following basic facts are true:

* The underlying associative monomial of a basic Lie product is a regular word.
* For every regular word, there is a unique basic Lie product having that as the underlying associative monomial.

===Right-normed definition===

{{fillin}}

==Facts==

{{further|[[Basic Lie products form a freely generating set of graded component of free Lie algebra]]}}

Consider the free <math>\mathbb{Q}</math>-Lie algebra on <math>x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n</math>. The basic Lie products defined here form a basis for this Lie algebra as a <math>\mathbb{Q}</math>-vector space. Moreover, the basic Lie products of length <math>r</math> form a basis for the degree <math>r</math> homogeneous component of the free Lie algebra.

This basis is termed the '''Lyndon basis''' or the '''Shirshov basis'''.

In fact, the basic Lie products form a free generating set for the degree <math>r</math> homogeneous component of the <math>\mathbb{Z}</math>-Lie algebra, which is a free abelian group.

This fact can also be used to give a formula for the dimension of the homogeneous graded components of free Lie algebras. For more, see [[formula for dimension of graded component of free Lie algebra]].

==Particular cases==

===Basic Lie products in two variables: left-normed version===

The variables are taken as <math>x_1</math> and <math>x_2</math>. We list all the basic Lie products in the left-normed version of weight up to five.

Suppose <math>R</math> is a [[non-associative ring]] and <math>\theta: R \to R</math> is an [[endomorphism]] of the additive group of <math>R</math>. Suppose <math>n</math> is a nonnegative integer. We say that <math>\theta</math> is <math>n</math>-step-binilpotent if the following equivalent conditions hold (note that we define <math>\theta^0</math> as the identity map):

* <math>\theta^i(x) * \theta^j(y) = 0</math> for all <math>x,y \in R</math> and all nonnegative integers <math>i,j</math> with <math>i + j = n</math>.

==Definition==

===Definition with symbols===

A ''quantified word-letter pair'' is a word with a distinguished letter, with a sequence of (possibly nested) existential and universal quantifiers on all the other letters. An element <math>g</math> in a group <math>G</math> satisfies this pair if setting the distinguished letter equal to <math>g</math>, the nested expression is true in the group (where existential and universal quantifiers are interpreted over <math>G</math>). The subgroup corresponding to a quantified word-letter pair is defined as the subgroup generated by all elements of the group satisfying that pair.

A bound-word subgroup is a possibly arbitrary [[join of subgroups|join]] of finite intersections of subgroups corresponding to quantified word-letter pairs.

==Definition==

The '''Burnside group''' <math>B(d,n)</math> (sometimes called the '''free Burnside group''') is defined as the quotient of the [[free group]] on <math>d</math> generators by the [[normal subgroup]] generated by all <math>n^{th}</math> powers. A Burnside group is a group that occurs as <math>B(d,n)</math> for some choice of <math>d</math> and <math>n</math>.

Note that any Burnside group is a [[reduced free group]] because it is a [[quotient group]] of a [[free group]] by a [[verbal subgroup]]. More explicitly, <math>B(d,n)</math> is free in the subvariety of the variety of groups comprising those groups where <math>n^{th}</math> powers are equal to the identity. In particular, any Burnside group is a [[group in which every fully invariant subgroup is verbal]].

== Relation with Burnside problem ==

{{further|[[Burnside problem]]}}

The Burnside problem is the problem of determining the conditions on <math>n</math> under which the Burnside groups <math>B(d,n)</math> are all finite. For some small values of <math>n</math>, the Burnside groups are all finite, whereas for large enough values of <math>n</math>, the Burnside groups are all infinite for <math>d > 1</math>.

Explicitly, it is the [[quotient group]] of [[free group:F2]] by relations that say that the fourth power of every element is the identity element.

The group is too big to have a GAP ID, but it can be constructed by imposing fourth power relations:

<pre>gap> F := FreeGroup(2);;
gap> R1 := [F.1,F.2,(F.1*F.2),Comm(F.1,F.2),(F.1*F.2^2),(F.1^(-1)*F.2),(F.1^(-1)*F.2^2),Comm(F.1,Comm(F.1,F.2)),Comm(F.1,F.2^2),Comm(F.1^(-1),F.2)];;
gap> R2 := [F.1*F.2*F.1,F.2*F.1*F.2,F.1*F.2*F.1^2,Comm(F.1,F.1*F.2*F.1)];;

gap> S := List(R,x -> x^4);;
gap> K := F/S;;
gap> U := Set(List(Set(K),x -> x^4));;

{{quotation|''The term '''c-closed subgroup''' has also been used in the past for [[conjugacy-closed subgroup]]''}}

==Definition==

===Symbol-free definition===

A [[subgroup]] of a [[group]] is termed a '''c-closed subgroup''' if it satisfies the equivalent conditions:

* It equals the centralizer of its centralizer.
* It occurs as the [[centralizer]] of some subset of the group
* It occurs as the centralizer of some subgroup

Alternative terminology for a c-closed subgroup is '''centralizer subgroup''', '''self-bicommutant subgroup''', '''self-bicentralizer subgroup'''.

==Formalisms==

The property of being a centralizer subgroup is a {{Galois correspondence-closed subgroup property}}, with respect to the [[Galois correspondence induced by relation of commuting]].

==Metaproperties==

{{transitive}}

A c-closed subgroup of a c-closed subgroup is again c-closed. {{further|[[C-closedness is transitive]]}}
{{intersection-closed}}

An arbitrary intersection of centralizer subgroups is a centralizer subgroup; this follows from general facts about Galois correspondences. In fact, even an empty intersection of centralizer subgroups is a centralizer subgroups, so the property is actually [[strongly intersection-closed subgroup property|strongly intersection-closed]].

{{term introduced by|Wang}}

Wang introduced the notion of c-normal subgroup in his paper '' C -Normality of Groups and Its Properties''.

==Definition==

===Symbol-free definition===

A [[subgroup]] of a [[group]] is termed '''c-normal''' if there is a normal subgroup whose product with it is the whole group and whose intersection with it lies inside its [[normal core]].

===Definition with symbols===

A subgroup <math>H</math> of a group <math>G</math> is termed '''c-normal''' if there is a normal subgroup <math>T</math> such that the intersection of <math>H</math> and <math>T</math> lies inside the normal core of <math>H</math>, and such that <math>HT = G</math>.

==Relation with other properties==

==Metaproperties==

{{intsubcondn}}

If <math>H</math> is c-normal in <math>G</math>, with <math>T</math> being a normal subgroup that shows it, then <math>H</math> is also c-normal in any intermediate subgroup <math>K</math>, and further, the normal subgroup that does the trick is <math>T \cap K</math>. This follows because:

<math>H(T \cap K) = HT \cap K = G \cap K = K</math>

(the first step is the famous [[modular property of groups]] and can be proved easily.)

==Definition==

===Symbol-free definition===

A [[subgroup]] of a [[group]] is termed a '''CEP subgroup''' (or a group with '''Congruence Extension Property''') if any [[normal subgroup]] of this subgroup is the intersection of this subgroup with a [[normal subgroup]] of the whole group.

CEP-subgroups are also termed '''normal-sensitive subgroups'''.

===Definition with symbols===

A [[subgroup]] <math>H</math> of a [[group]] <math>G</math> is termed a '''CEP subgroup''' if for any [[normal subgroup]] <math>N</math> of <math>H</math>, there is a normal subgroup <math>M</math> of <math>G</math> such that <math>N = M</math> &cap; <math>H</math>.

==Formalisms==

===In terms of the subgroup intersection extension formalism===

In terms of the [[subgroup intersection extension formalism]], the property of being a CEP subgroup is the balanced property with respect to the subgroup property of [[normality]].

==Facts==

Every [[subgroup]] of a [[group]] is a CEP-subgroup if and only if the group is a [[solvable group|solvable]] [[T-group]].

==Relation with other properties==

* [[Weaker than::Transitively normal subgroup]]

===Weaker properties===

* [[Stronger than::Subgroup in which every relatively normal subgroup is strongly closed]]
* [[Stronger than::Subgroup in which every relatively normal subgroup is weakly closed]]

==Metaproperties==

{{transitive}}

Any CEP subgroup of a CEP subgroup is a CEP subgroup. This follows from the fact that the property of being CEP is a ''balanced'' subgroup property with respect to a suitable formalism.

{{trim}}

The [[improper subgroup]], or the whole group, is clearly a CEP subgroup, so the property of being a CEP subgroup is [[identity-true subgroup property|identity-true]]. 

The trivial subgroup is also a CEP subgroup, so the property of being a CEP subgroup is [[trivially  true]].

Thus, the property of being a CEP subgroup is a [[trim subgroup property]].

{{group property}}

==Definition==

A '''CS-Baer Lie group''' is a [[group]] <math>G</math> satisfying '''both''' the following two conditions:

# <math>G</math> is a [[defining ingredient::group of nilpotency class two]], i.e., its [[nilpotency class]] is at most two. Equivalently, the [[derived subgroup]] <math>[G,G]</math> is contained in the [[center]] <math>Z(G)</math> of <math>G</math>.
# There exists a subgroup <math>H</math> of <math>G</math> such that <math>[G,G] \le H \le Z(G)</math>, and every element of <math>[G,G]</math> has a unique square root within <math>H</math>.

== Examples ==

=== Finite examples ===

For [[finite group]]s, being a CS-Baer Lie group is equivalent to being a [[LCS-Baer Lie group]], which in turn means that it is a group of class two whose 2-Sylow subgroup is abelian.

=== Infinite examples ===

There are examples of infinite groups that are CS-Baer but not LCS-Baer. The smallest example is [[central product of UT(3,Z) and Z identifying center with 2Z]]. Note that this particular example is a [[LUCS-Baer Lie group]] (see [[LUCS-Baer Lie group#Examples]]).

We can create examples of CS-Baer Lie groups that are neither LUCS-Baer Lie groups nor LCS-Baer Lie groups, by combining features of the above examples. Specifically, let <math>G</math> be the group [[central product of UT(3,Z) and Z identifying center with 2Z]]. Then, the group <math>G \times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}</math> is a CS-Baer Lie group but it fails to be a LUCS-Baer Lie group (since it has 2-torsion within the center). It also fails to be a LCS-Baer Lie group (since the derived subgroup itself does not allow for halving).

==Definition==

A [[Lazard-divided Lie ring]] is termed a '''canonically Lazard-divided Lie ring''' if all the Lazard division operations are invariant under all the automorphisms of the underlying [[Lie ring]].

The corresponding property of the underlying Lie ring is termed [[canonically Lazard-dividable Lie ring]].

{{group property}}

==Definition==

A [[group]] <math>G</math> is said to be '''capable''' if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:

# It is isomorphic to the [[defining ingredient::inner automorphism group]] of some group. In other words, there is a group <math>H</math> such that <math>G</math> is isomorphic to the [[quotient group]] <math>H/Z(H)</math> where <math>Z(H)</math> is the [[center]] of the group.
# Its [[defining ingredient::epicenter]] is the [[trivial group]].

===In terms of the image operator===

The group property of being a capable group is obtained by applying the [[image operator]] for the [[quotient-defining function]] sending each group to its inner automorphism group.

==Facts==

* The [[trivial group]] is capable; it occurs as the inner automorphism group of any [[abelian group]]
* A nontrivial [[cyclic group]] cannot be capable. This is because there cannot be an element ''outside'' the center of a group, which, along with the center, generates the whole group. {{proofat|[[cyclic and capable implies trivial]]}}

{{finite-case subgroup-conjugacy-class-defining function}}

==History==

===Origin===

{{term introduced by|Carter}}

The notion of '''Carter subgroup''' was introduced in a paper by Roger W. Carter where he showed that in solvable groups, the Carter subgroups (as he defined them) form a single conjugacy class of subgroups.

===Development===

Through a long series of papers (see the References below) which first explored Carter subgroups of solvable groups, and then Carter subgroups of various linear groups and groups of Lie type, it has finally been shown that in any [[finite group]], the Carter subgroups form a single conjugacy class. The final proof was by Vdovin, in his paper ''Carter subgroups of finite almost simple groups''.

==Definition==

===Symbol-free definition===

A [[subgroup]] of a [[group]] is termed a '''Carter subgroup''' if it is a [[self-normalizing subgroup|self-normalizing]] [[nilpotent group|nilpotent]] subgroup.

===Definition with symbols===

A [[subgroup]] <math>H</math> of a [[group]] <math>G</math> is termed a '''Carter subgroup''' if <math>H</math> is [[nilpotent group|nilpotent]] as an abstract group and if <math>N_G(H) = H</math> where <math>N_G(H)</math> denotes the [[normalizer]] of <math>H</math> in <math>G</math>.

==Relation with other properties==

===Weaker properties===

* [[Self-normalizing subgroup]]

==Facts==

In a solvable group, there exist Carter subgroups, and all Carter subgroups are conjugate. This was proved in Carter's original paper.

It has recently been proved (by Vdovin, in his paper ''Carter subgroups of finite almost simple groups'') that the Carter subgroups in any finite group are conjugate.

{{basicdef}}
{{subgroup-defining function}}

==Definition==

===Symbol-free definition===

An element of a [[group]] is termed central if the following equivalent conditions hold:

# It commutes with every element of the group
# Its [[centralizer]] is the whole group
# It is the only element in its [[conjugacy class]]. In other words, under the [[group acts as automorphisms by conjugation|action of the group on itself by conjugation]], it is a fixed point.
# Under the [[group acts as automorphisms by conjugation|action of the group on itself by conjugation]], it fixes everything. In other words, it is in the kernel of the action of the group on itself by conjugation.

The '''center''' of a group is the set of its central elements. The center is clearly a [[subgroup]].

Alternatively, the center of a group is defined as the kernel of the homomorphism from the group to its automorphism group, that sends each element to the corresponding inner automorphism. (see [[group acts as automorphisms by conjugation]]).

===Definition with symbols===

Given a [[group]] <math>G</math>, the '''center''' of <math>G</math>, denoted <math>Z(G)</math>, is defined as the set of elements <math>g</math> that satisfy the following equivalent conditions:

# <math>gx = xg</math> for all <math>x</math> in <math>G</math>
# <math>C_G(g) = G</math>
# The [[conjugacy class]] of <math>g</math> in <math>G</math> is the singleton <math>\{ g \}</math>. In other words, under the action of <math>G</math> on itself by conjugation, the orbit of <math>g</math> is a one-point set -- <math>g</math> is a fixed point.
# For the action of <math>G</math> on itself by conjugation, <math>g</math> acts trivially on everything. In other words, conjugation by <math>g</math> fixes every element.

Alternatively, <math>Z(G)</math> is defined as the kernel of the map <math>G \to \operatorname{Aut}(G)</math> given by <math>g \mapsto c_g</math>, where <math>c_g = x \mapsto gxg^{-1}</math> is conjugation by <math>g</math>. (see [[group acts as automorphisms by conjugation]]).

==Group properties==

The center of any group must be an [[abelian group]]. Conversely every abelian group occurs as the center of some group (in fact, of itself).

==Associated constructions==

{| class="sortable" border="1"
! Construction !! Name !! Description
|-
| associated [[quotient-defining function]] || [[inner automorphism group]] || The quotient of a group by its center is isomorphic to the group of [[inner automorphism]]s, i.e. the subgroup of the [[automorphism group]] comprising those automorphisms that can be expressed using conjugation maps. This is because the map from a group to its automorphism group that sends <math>g</math> to <math>c_g: x \mapsto gxg^{-1}</math> is a homomorphism, and its kernel is precisely the center <math>Z(G)</math>.
|-
| associated [[ascending series]] || [[upper central series]] || Start with a group <math>G</math>. The upper central series of <math>G</math> is defined as follows. Consider <math>Z^1(G) = Z(G)</math>. Let <math>Z^i(G)</math>, in general, be the inverse image in <math>G</math> of <math>Z(G/Z^{i-1}(G))</math> under the canonical projection <math>G \to G/Z^{i-1}(G)</math>. Essentially we are iterating the [[quotient-defining function]] that sends a group to the inner automorphism group, and taking the kernel at each step. However, we are pulling back that kernel all the way to <math>G</math>. <br>By convention (and commonsense) <math>Z^0(G)</math> is the [[trivial group]].<br> A group for which the upper central series terminates in finite length at the whole group is termed a [[nilpotent group]].
|}

==Examples==

Below are some examples where the center is a proper and nontrivial subgroup. In other words, these examples exclude [[abelian group]]s (where the center is the whole group) and [[centerless group]]s (where the center is trivial):

The '''quotient part''' in the table below refers to the quotient by the center, which is isomorphic to the [[inner automorphism group]].

==Relation with other subgroup-defining functions==

===Smaller subgroup-defining functions===

* [[Contains::Absolute center]]: This is the set of elements of the group fixed by ''every'' [[automorphism]] (not just by every [[inner automorphism]]).
* [[Contains::Epicenter]]: Intersection of inverse images of centers for all [[central extension]]s.
* For a [[group of prime power order]], the first omega subgroup (i.e., the subgroup comprising elements of order at most equal to the prime) of the center equals the [[socle]] of the whole group, i.e., the join of all the minimal normal subgroups. This subgroup, denoted <math>\Omega_1(Z(G))</math> where <math>G</math> is the whole group, is important in many contexts. {{further|[[socle equals Omega-1 of center in nilpotent p-group]]}}

===Topological group===

The center of a [[T0 topological group]] is always a [[closed subgroup]]. Thus, any [[topologically simple group]] must be either [[centerless group|centerless]] or [[abelian group|abelian]].

==Computation==

===The computation problem===

{{fillin}}

{{GAP command for sdf|Center}}

To compute the center of a group in GAP, the syntax is:

<tt>Center (group);</tt>

where <tt>group</tt> could either be an on-the-spot description of the group or a name alluding to a previously defined group.

We can assign this as a value, to a new name, for instance:

<tt>zg := Center (g);</tt>

where <tt>g</tt> is the original group and <tt>zg</tt> is the center.

A [[group]] is said to be '''centerless''' if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:

* The center of the group is [[trivial group|trivial]].
* The [[group acts as automorphisms by conjugation|natural homomorphism from the group to its automorphism group]] that sends each element to the conjugation it induces, is injective (viz no two elements induce the same inner automorphism)

A [[direct product]] of centerless groups is centerless. This follows from the general fact that the center of a direct product equals the direct product of the individual centers.

==Terminological note==

The term '''central factor''' used here refers to a [[subgroup]] that can occur as a factor in a central product. The term ''central factor'' is also used in another, completely different sense: a group that occurs as a quotient by a [[central subgroup]] in another group, or in some cases, as a quotient by the whole [[center]] (in which case, it would be isomorphic to the [[inner automorphism group]]). These other senses of the word are very different, and you can learn more about these senses at the [[central extension]] page.

The subgroup property of being a central factor has a first-order description as follows. A subgroup <math>H</math> is a central factor in a group <math>G</math> if and only if:

<math>\forall g \in G, \exists h \in H . \forall x \in H, \qquad  hxh^{-1} = gxg^{-1}</math>

==Definition==

===Symbol-free definition===

A subgroup of a group is termed a '''central factor of normalizer''' if it satisfies the following equivalent conditinos:

* It is a [[central factor]] of its [[normalizer]]
* Every [[inner automorphism]] of the group that restricts to an automorphism on the subgroup restricts to an [[inner automorphism]] on the subgroup.

===Definition with symbols===

A subgroup <math>H</math> of a group <math>G</math> is termed a '''central factor of normalizer''' if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:

* <math>HC_G(H) = N_G(H)</math> where <math>C_G(H)</math> denotes the [[centralizer]] of <math>H</math> in <math>G</math>.
* For any <math>g</math> in <math>G</math> such that <math>gHg^{-1} = H</math>, there exists an element <math>h</math> in <math>H</math> such that for any <math>x</math> in <math>G</math>, <math>gxg^{-1} = hxh^{-1}</math>.

==Formalisms==

{{first-order subgroup property}}

A subgroup <math>H</math> of a group <math>G</math> is a WC-subgroup if it satisfies the following condition:

<math>\forall g \in G, (\exists h \in H . \forall x \in H, hxh^{-1} = gxg^{-1}) \lor (\exists x \in H . gxg^{-1} \notin H)</math>


{{obtainedbyapplyingthe|in-normalizer operator|central factor}}

A subgroup is a WC-subgroup if and only if it is a central factor of its normalizer. This can be expressed in terms of the[[in-normalizer operator]]. The in-normalizer operator takes a subgroup property <math>p</math> and outputs the property of being a subgroup that satisfies property <math>p</math> inside the normalizer.

===In terms of the when-defined restriction formalism===

The property of being a WC subgroup is the balanced property with respect to the [[when-defined function restriction formalism]]. Note that balanced properties for ''when-defined'' formalisms are not necessarily transitive.

==Relation with other properties==

===Stronger properties===

* [[Central factor]]: Its normalizer is the whole group, and it is clearly a central factor in that
* [[Self-normalizing subgroup]]: Its normalizer is itself, and it is clearly a central factor of itself.
* [[Cocentral subgroup]]

===Weaker properties===

* [[Sub-WC-subgroup]]

==Metaproperties==

{{intransitive}}

Check out the [[#Property operators|property operators part of this page]] for more details.

===Intersection-closedness===

It seems unlikely that an intersection of WC-subgroups should again be a WC-subgroup.

{{intsubcondn}}

If <math>G \le H \le K</math> and <math>G</math> be a WC-subgroup of <math>K</math>. Then, any inner automorphism of <math>H</math> arises from an inner automorphism of <math>K</math>, hence the restriction of an inner automorphism of <math>H</math> to <math>G</math> is also the restriction of an inner automorphism of <math>K</math> to <math>G</math>. Hence, it must be an inner automorphism of <math>G</math>.

==Effect of property operators==

===Right transiter===

Any WC-subgroup of a central factor is a WC-subgroup. Thus, the [[right transiter]] of the property of being a WC-subgroup is weaker than the property of being a central factor. It's not clear whether it is exactly equal.

===Subordination===

The property of being a WC subgroup is not transitive. Thus, there is a notion of [[sub-WC-subgroup]].

===Symbol-free definition===

===Definition with symbols===

An [[automorphism]] <math>\sigma</math> of a [[group]] <math>G</math> is termed '''central factor-extensible''' if, for every embedding of <math>G</math> as a [[central factor]] in a group <math>H</math>, there exists an automorphism <math>\varphi</math> of <math>H</math> whose restriction to <math>G</math> is <math>\sigma</math>.

In a [[centerless group]], ''every'' automorphism is central factor-extensible. This is because any central factor that is centerless as a group must be a direct factor.

==History==

===Origin of the term===

The term was first used in the paper ''Transfer and fusion in finite groups'' by Finkel and Gorenstein in the Journal of Algebra, 6 (1967), Pages 242-255.

==Definition==
===Definition with symbols===

Let <math>G</math> be a group and <math>p</math> a prime. A '''central functor''' is a map <math>V</math> from the collection of <math>p</math>-subgroups of <math>G</math> to the collection of <math>p</math>-subgroups of <math>G</math> that satisfies:

* For any <math>p</math>-subgroup <math>H</math>, <math>V(H) \le Z(H)</math>.
* For any <math>p</math>-subgroup <math>H</math>, and any <math>x in G</math>, <math>W(H^x) = (W(H))^x</math>.
* If <math>Z(H) \le Z(K)</math> then <math>V(H) \le V(K)</math>.

Clearly, every central functor is a [[conjugacy functor]].

Examples of central functor include the center and the <math>p^{th}</math> powers of elements in the center.

# It is the [[central product]] of [[unitriangular matrix group:UT(3,Z)]] and the [[group of integers]] <math>\mathbb{Z}</math> where the subgroup <math>2\mathbb{Z}</math> of <math>\mathbb{Z}</math> is identified with the center of <math>UT(3,\mathbb{Z})</math>.

==Definition==

===Symbol-free definition===

A [[subgroup]] of a [[group]] is termed a '''central subgroup''' if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:

# It is a subgroup inside the [[center]]
# Every [[inner automorphism]] of the whole group restricts to the identity map on the subgroup
# Every element of the subgroup commutes with every element of the group
# It is a [[central factor]] of the whole group, and is [[Abelian group|Abelian]] as a subgroup.
===Definition with symbols===

A [[subgroup]] <math>H</math> of a [[group]] <math>G</math> is termed '''central''' if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:

# <math>H \le Z(G)</math>
# For any <math>x</math> in <math>G</math>, the map sending <math>h</math> in <math>H</math> to <math>xhx^{-1}</math> is the identity map.
# For any <math>x</math> in <math>G</math> and <math>h</math> in <math>H</math>, <math>xh=hx</math>.
# <math>H</math> is an Abelian group, and <math>HC_G(H) = G</math>.

===Equivalence of definitions===

The equivalence of definitions (1), (2) and (3) follows directly from the definition of center. For the equivalence with (4), refer [[Abelian central factor equals central subgroup]].

==Metaproperties==

{{Abelian-tautological subgroup property}}

Any subgroup of an abelian group is central.

{{left-hereditary}}

Any subgroup of a central subgroup is central. Thus, the property of being a central subgroup is left-hereditary.

{{intersection-closed}}

An intersection of central subgroups is central. This follows as an easy corollary of the fact that ''any'' subgroup of a central subgroup is central.

{{join-closed}}

The subgroup generated by a family of central subgroups is central. In fact, the subgroup generated by all central subgroups is precisely the [[center]], and this is the largest central subgroup.

{{intsubcondn}}

Any central subgroup of a group is also a central subgroup in any intermediate subgroup. Thus, the property of being a central subgroup satisfies the [[intermediate subgroup condition]].

{{imagecondn}}

The image of a central subgroup under a surjective homomorphism is central in the image.

===Trimness===

The property of being a central subgroup is [[trivially true subgroup property|trivially true]], but is not [[identity-true subgroup property|identity-true]]. In fact, a group is a central subgroup of itself if and only if it is [[Abelian group|Abelian]].

{{group property}}

==Definition==

A group is said to be '''centralizer-connected''' if the centralizer of any element is either the whole group or has infinite index in the group., or equivalently, if every conjugacy class with more than one element has infinite size.

===Reason for the name===

The concept of '''centralizer-connected''' is closely related to the concept of connected. In particular, for a [[connected topological group]], every conjugacy class is connected (as it arises as the image of the group under a continuous map). Hence, it must either be a single point or infinite in size, so it must be centralizer-connecteed.

{{trim}}

The trivial subgroup is clearly CC, and so is the whole group. Thus, the property of being a CC-subgroup is also a {{t.i.}}

Note that proper nontrivial CC-subgroups can occur only in a [[centerless group]].

{{intsubcondn}}

Any subgroup that is CC in the whole group, is also CC in any intermediate subgroup. This is because the centralizer in any intermediate subgroup is contained inside the centralizer in the whole group.

* As the intersection of all [[defining ingredient::characteristic subgroup]]s containing the given subgroup
* As the subgroup generated by all [[defining ingredient::automorphic subgroups]] to the given subgroup

===Normal closure operator===

The fact that characteristicity is the [[left transiter]] for normality has an interesting implication on the relation between characteristic closure and normal closure. Namely, given a subgroup <math>H</math> of <math>G</math>, the characteristic closure of <math>H</math> in <math>G</math> is the smallest subgroup <math>L</math> containing <math>H</math> such that whenever <math>G \triangleleft K</math>, <math>L \triangleleft K</math>.

In other words, the normal closure of a subgroup may not remain a normal closure if we expand the bigger group. However,the characteristic closure remains normal even in an expanded bigger group (as long we we expand normally).

==Facts==

===Characteristic closure of a minimal normal subgroup is a direct power of it===

We can prove that for any [[minimal normal subgroup]], the characteristic closure is a direct product of its automorphs. The idea of the proof is induction -- we build a collection of automorphs of the minimal normal subgroup. At each stage, we check if the automorphs generate the characteristic closure. If they do, then we have shown that the characteristic closure is a direct product of automorphs.

Otherwise, there is some automorph not in the direct product of automorphs so far. Since this automorph is again a minimal normal subgroup, it must intersect the direct product so far, trivially. Thus, we have got a bigger direct product.

===Equivalent definitions in tabular format===

Below are many '''equivalent''' definitions of characteristic subgroup.

{{tabular definition format}}

===Notation and terminology===

For a subgroup <math>H \!</math> of a group <math>G \!</math>, we denote the characteristicity of <math>\! H</math> in <math>\! G</math> by <math>H \operatorname{char} G</math>.

===Equivalence of definitions===

The equivalence of these definitions follows from a more general fact: [[Restriction of automorphism to subgroup invariant under it and its inverse is automorphism]]. In other words, we use the fact that both <math>\varphi</math> and <math>\varphi^{-1}</math> send <math>H</math> to within itself to show that <math>\varphi(H) = H</math>. It is not in general true that if an automorphism of a group restricts to a subgroup, then the restriction is an automorphism of the subgroup: [[Restriction of automorphism to subgroup not implies automorphism]].<section end="main"/>

===Copyable LaTeX===

<pre>A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is termed a {\em characteristic subgroup} if $\varphi(H) = H$ for all automorphisms $\varphi$ of $G$.</pre>

==Importance==

Characteristic subgroups are important because they are genuinely ''invariant'', not just under inner automorphisms, but under all automorphisms. In particular, every [[subgroup-defining function]] gives rise to a characteristic subgroup.

==Examples==
{{subgroup property see examples}}
===Extreme examples===

# Every group is characteristic as a subgroup of itself.
# The trivial subgroup is characteristic in any group.

===Examples in abelian groups===

{| class="sortable" border="1"

| [[cyclic group]] || high || ''every'' subgroup is characteristic: [[cyclic implies every subgroup is characteristic]] || every subgroup can be described as the set of <math>d^{th}</math> powers for some <math>d</math>. This set is invariant under automorphisms. 
|-

See [[power subgroup]].
|-
| [[elementary abelian group]], more generally [[additive group of a field]] || low || no characteristic subgroups other than trivial subgroup and whole group || The additive group of a field or of a vector space over a field is a [[group whose automorphism group is transitive on non-identity elements]]. Hence, it is a [[characteristically simple group]] -- any nontrivial characteristic subgroup must be the whole group.
|}

===Examples using subgroup-defining functions across all groups===

In a non-abelian group, some typical examples of characteristic subgroups are given by [[subgroup-defining function]]s (something which uniquely returns a particular subgroup). For instance, we have the following subgroup-defining functions, some of which are interesting for abelian groups as well:

{| class="sortable" border="1"
! Subgroup-defining function !! Definition !! Proof of characteristicity
|-
| [[Frattini subgroup]] || intersection of all [[maximal subgroup]]s || [[Frattini subgroup is characteristic]]
|-
| [[derived subgroup]] || subgroup generated by all [[commutator]]s || [[derived subgroup is characteristic]]
|-
| [[center]] || set of elements that commute with every element || [[center is characteristic]]
|}

For a complete list of subgroup-defining functions, see [[:Category:Subgroup-defining functions]].

Similarly, all terms of the [[upper central series]], [[lower central series]], [[Frattini series]], [[derived series]], [[Fitting series]] and other series associated with the group, are characteristic.

For a finite group, any [[normal Sylow subgroup]], and more generally, any [[normal Hall subgroup]], is characteristic. More generally, the [[normal core]] of any [[Sylow subgroup]] or any [[Hall subgroup]], is characteristic.

==Formalisms==

{{wikilocal-section}}

===Varietal formalism===

The notion of characteristic subgroup can be defined as the notion of [[defining ingredient::characteristic subalgebra]] in the [[variety of groups]].

{{second-order subgroup property}}

The second-order description of characteristicity is as follows. We say <math>H</math> is characteristic in <math>G</math> if:

<math>\ \forall g \in H, \sigma \in \operatorname{Aut}(G) : \  \sigma(g) \in H</math>

The key point is that quantification over <math>\operatorname{Aut}(G)</math> is a second-order quantification.

{{frexp}}

{| class="sortable" border="1"
! Function restriction expression !! <math>H</math> is a characteristic subgroup of <math>G</math> if ... !! This means that characteristicity is ... !! Additional comments
|-
| {{invariance-short|automorphism}} ||
|-
| {{endo-invariance-short|automorphism}} ||
|-
| {{balance-short|automorphism}}
|}

{{riexp}}

Characteristicity can be expressed in the [[relation implication formalism]] with the left side being [[automorph]]s (i.e., subgroups resembling each other via an automorphism of the whole group) and the right side being '''equal subgroups''':

Characteristic = [[Automorphic subgroups]] <math>\implies</math> Equal subgroups

In other words, a subgroup is characteristic if and only if every subgroup equivalent to it in the sense of being an automorph, is actually equal to it.

==Testing==

===The testing problem===

{{further|[[characteristicity testing problem]]}}

Given generating sets for a group and a subgroup, the problem of determining whether the subgroup is characteristic in the group cannot be solved directly. However, it can be reduced to the problem of finding a small generating set for the [[automorphism group]] of the bigger group.

{{GAP command for subgroup property|
test = IsCharacteristicSubgroup|
list = CharacteristicSubgroups}}

The GAP syntax for testing whether a subgroup is characteristic in a group is:

<tt>IsCharacteristicSubgroup (group, subgroup);</tt>

where <tt>subgroup</tt> and <tt>group</tt> may be defined on the spot in terms of generators or may refer to things defined previously.

The list of all characteristic subgroups can be obtained by:

<tt>CharacteristicSubgroups(group);</tt>

==State of discourse==

{{msc class|20A05}}

Broadly speaking, "characteristic subgroups" are not a separate area of study in group theory, but rather, characteristic subgroups are an important part of the vocabulary that comes up in any sufficiently "pure" study of group theory. Characteristic subgroups are relatively less important in the study of group actions, and more important in the study of abstract group structure.

===History===

{{term introduced by|Ferdinand Georg Frobenius}}

The notion of '''characteristic subgroup''' was introduced by [[Frobenius]] in 1895. His motivation was to capture the property of being a subgroup that is ''invariant'' under all symmetries of the group, and is hence ''intrinsic'' to the group. Frobenius wanted to use the term ''invariant subgroup'' but at the time, the term ''invariant subgroup'' was used for [[normal subgroup]].

===Resolution of questions that are easy to formulate===

Any typical question about the behavior of characteristic subgroups in arbitrary groups that is easy to formulate will also be easy to resolve either with a proof or a counterexample, unless some ''other'' feature of the question significantly complicates it. This is so, despite the fact that there are a large number of easy-to-formulate questions about the [[automorphism group]] that are still open. The reason is that even though not enough is known about the automorphism groups, there are other ways to obtain information about the structure of characteristic subgroups.

At the one extreme, there are [[abelian group]]s, where the characteristic subgroups are quite easy to get a handle on. At the other extreme, there are "all groups" where very little can be said about characteristic subgroups beyond what can be proved through elementary reasoning. The most interesting situation is in the middle, for instance, when we are looking at [[nilpotent group]]s and [[solvable group]]s. In these cases, there are some restrictions on the structure of characteristic subgroups, but the exact nature of the restrictions is hard to work out.

Below are listed some of the more cutting-edge questions that are relatively easy to formulate and are partially open.

{| class="sortable" border="1"
! Problem description !! More details
|-
| [[potentially characteristic subgroups characterization problem]] || This problem (or rather, constellation of problems) asks, given a subgroup <math>H \le G</math>, whether there exists a group <math>K</math> containing <math>G</math> such that <math>H</math> is characteristic in <math>K</math>. Questions of this type are generally much harder to resolve than formulate.
|-
| [[Characteristic not implies powering-invariant in nilpotent group]] || This disproves the conjecture that if <math>H</math> is a [[characteristic subgroup]] of a [[nilpotent group]] <math>G</math>, then <math>H</math> is a [[powering-invariant subgroup]] of <math>G</math>, i.e., if <math>G</math> is [[powered group for a set of primes|powered over]] a prime <math>p</math> (unique <math>p</math>-divisibility), so is <math>H</math>.
|-
| [[Bryant-Kovacs theorem]] || This theorem provides a "rigidification" result that guarantees the existence of [[finite p-group]]s with specific patterns of characteristic subgroups containing the [[Frattini subgroup]].

When the group is finite, this is equivalent to it being a direct product of pairwise isomorphic [[simple group]]s; however, this is not true for infinite characteristicaly simple groups.

===Equivalence of definitions===

{{proofat|[[Equivalence of definitions of characteristically simple group]]}}

== Examples ==

* In the finite case, the characteristically simple groups are precisely the direct powers of simple groups. Thus, the characteristically simple abelian groups are precisely the [[elementary abelian group]]s, and the characteristically simple non-abelian groups are precisely the direct powers of the simple non-abelian groups.
* In the infinite case, there are more possibilities. For instance, the additive group of any vector space over any field is characteristically simple and abelian. On the non-abelian side, there are examples such as [[McLain's group]] over a field.

==Formalisms==

The [[group property]] of being characteristically simple is obtained by applying the [[simple group operator]] to the [[trim subgroup property]] of being [[characteristic subgroup|characteristic]].

==Statement==

===Statement in eigenspace terms===

Suppose <math>A = \mathbb{Q}\langle x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n \rangle</math> is a free associative <math>\mathbb{Q}</math>-algebra on finitely many variables <math>x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n</math>. Note that this is like a polynomial ring, except that the variables do not commute. Let <math>\mathbb{Q}L</math> be the <math>\mathbb{Q}</math>-Lie subalgebra of <math>A</math> generated by <math>x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n</math>. It is true that <math>L</math> is the free Lie algebra on <math>x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n</math>.

Let <math>k</math> be a positive integer. The claim is that the homogeneous degree <math>k</math> component of <math>\mathbb{Q}L</math> is equal to the eigenspace of the [[Dynkin operator]] with eigenvalue <math>k</math>. In other words, an element <math>a \in A</math> is in this degree <math>k</math> component if and only if <math>\delta(a) = ka</math>, where <math>\delta</math> denotes the Dynkin operator.

Note that the statement holds independent of whether we choose the left-normed or right-normed Dynkin operator. 

In particular, since <math>\mathbb{Q}L</math> is itself the direct sum of its homogeneous degree components, we obtain that <math>\mathbb{Q}L</math> is the direct sum of its eigenspaces for all positive integers.

===Statement in terms of ideals in the symmetric group===

Note that the Dynkin operator can be thought of as multiplication by the following element of <math>\mathbb{Q}[S_k]</math> (where we denote the identity element by <math>1</math>:

<math>(1 - (1,2,3,\dots,k)) \dots (1 - (1,2,3))(1 - (1,2))</math>

With this interpretation, the result says that for a  given <math>k</math>, the Schur functor describing the degree <math>k</math> Lie operad is the left ideal generated by the Dynkin element. 

Further, this tells us that the image of the degree <math>k</math> component of the associative algebra under the Dynkin element gives us the degree <math>k</math> component of <math>\mathbb{Q}L</math>.

==Significance for converting between formulas==

The above characterization is significant in the following sense. Given a formula for an element of <math>\mathbb{Q}L</math> in terms of sums of associative products, we can convert the formula to a formula in terms of sums of Lie products as follows.

===Left-normed Lie product version===

* Replace each associative product by the corresponding left-normed Lie product.
* Also, insert an extra factor in the denominator corresponding to the degree (weight) of the associative product.

===Right-normed Lie product version===

* Replace each associative product by the corresponding right-normed Lie product.
* Also, insert an extra factor in the denominator corresponding to the degree (weight) of the associative product.

{{particular group}}

==Definition==

This group is defined as <math>B_3(3)</math>, the [[Chevalley group of type B]] and parameter value 3 for [[field:F3]]. Explicitly, it is the [[kernel]] of the [[spinor norm]] map from [[special orthogonal group:SO(7,3)]].

It is an example of a simple non-abelian group that is not the only simple non-abelian group of its order. [[There are at most two finite simple groups of any order]]. The other group in this case is [[projective symplectic group:PSp(6,3)]], which in the Chevalley notation is <math>C_3(3)</math>. In general, <math>B_n(q)</math> and <math>C_n(q)</math> have the same order, but are isomorphic only if <math>n = 2</math> or <math>q</math> is a prime power.

{{particular group}}

==Definition==

This group is denoted <math>S^1, T, T^1</math> and is defined in a number of equivalent ways.

===As a multiplicative group of complex numbers===

The circle group is defined as the group, under multiplication, of complex numbers of modulus one. In other words, it is the group of complex numbers on the unit circle, under multiplication.

===As reals modulo integers===

An equivalent description of the circle group is as the [[quotient group]] <math>\R/\Z</math>, where <math>\R</math> is the additive [[group of real numbers]] and <math>\Z</math> is the subgroup of <math>\R</math> defined as the additive [[group of integers]].

Note that the isomorphism between the group <math>\R/\Z</math> and the complex numbers of modulus one is given by:

<math>\theta \mapsto e^{2\pi i \theta}</math>.

===As rotations===

The circle group can also be defined in the following equivalent ways:

* It is the group of rotations in the plane (including the identity map) that fix a particular point, under composition.
* It is the [[special orthogonal group]] of degree two over the real numbers. In other words, it is the group <math>SO(2,\R)</math>.

Note that the term '''circle group''' may be used for the more general notion of the circle group over any field or ring. The circle group over a field <math>k</math> is the group <math>SO(2,k)</math>.

An [[automorphism of a group]] is said to be '''class-inner''' if, given any [[conjugacy class]] in the group:

==Definition==

===Symbol-free definition===

An [[automorphism]] of a [[group]] is termed a '''class-inverting automorphism''' if it sends every element to an element that is in the [[conjugacy class]] of its inverse.

===Definition with symbols===

An [[automorphism]] <math>\sigma</math> of a [[group]] <math>G</math> is termed a '''class-inverting automorphism''' if, for any <math>g \in G</math>, there exists <math>x \in G</math> such that <math>\sigma(g) = xg^{-1}x^{-1}</math>.

Note that the set of class-inverting automorphisms, if non-empty, is a group only if the group is an [[ambivalent group]], i.e., every element is conjugate to its inverse. In this case, it is the group of [[class-preserving automorphism]]s.

Otherwise, it is a single coset of the group of [[class-preserving automorphism]]s, and the class-preserving and class-inverting automorphisms together form a [[normal subgroup]] of the automorphism group.

Clearly, a product of class automorphisms is a class automorphism, and the inverse of a class automorphism is a class automorphism. Thus, the class automorphisms form a group which sits as a subgroup of the automorphism group. Moreover, this subgroup contains the group of [[inner automorphism]]s, and is a [[normal subgroup]] inside the automorphism group.

===Dichotomy===

For a group with nontrivial center, any [[maximal subgroup]] of a group is either cocentral or contains the center of the group. This idea is of use in proving that [[maximal subgroup of nilpotent group implies normal|every maximal subgroup of a nilpotent group is normal]]. It is also related to the fact that [[upper join-closure of cocentrality is central factor]].

===Trimness===

The property of being cocentral is an {{i-true}}, that is, every group is cocentral as a subgroup of itself. However, it is not in general [[trivially true subgroup property|trivially true]]. In fact, the trivial subgroup is cocentral if and only if the group is [[abelian group|abelian]].

{{intsubcondn}}

If <math>H</math> is cocentral in <math>G</math>, <math>H</math> is also cocentral in any intermediate subgroup <math>K</math>. This follows from the fact that <math>Z(K)</math> contains <math>K \cap Z(G)</math>. {{proofat|[[Cocentrality satisfies intermediate subgroup condition]]}}

{{transitive}}

If <math>H \le K \le G</math>, with <math>H</math> a cocentral subgroup of <math>K</math> and <math>K</math> a cocentral subgroup of <math>G</math>, then <math>H</math> is cocentral in <math>G</math>. {{proofat|[[Cocentrality is transitive]]}}

{{upward-closed}}

{{automorphism property}}

==Definition==

===For a finite group===

An automorphism <math>\sigma</math> of a [[finite group]] <math>G</math> is termed a '''cofactorial automorphism''' for <math>G</math> if every prime dividing the [[order of an element|order]] of <math>\sigma</math> (viewed as an element of the [[automorphism group]] of <math>G</math>) also divides the [[order of a group|order]] of <math>G</math>.

===For a periodic group===

An automorphism <math>\sigma</math> of a [[periodic group]] <math>G</math> is termed a '''cofactorial automorphism''' for <math>G</math> if every prime dividing the order of <math>\sigma</math> equals the order of some non-identity element of <math>G</math>.

{{subgroup property}}

==Definition==

A subgroup of a group is termed a '''cofactorial automorphism-invariant subgroup''' if it is invariant under all the [[defining ingredient::cofactorial automorphism]]s of the whole group.

===For a finite group===

Suppose <math>G</math> is a [[finite group]]. A [[subgroup]] <math>H</math> of <math>G</math> is termed a '''cofactorial automorphism-invariant subgroup''' if <math>H</math> is invariant under every automorphism <math>\sigma</math> of <math>G</math> for which all prime factors of the order of <math>\sigma</math> are prime factors of the order of <math>G</math>.

===For a periodic group===

Suppose <math>G</math> is a [[periodic group]]: every element of <math>G</math> has finite order. A [[subgroup]] <math>H</math> of <math>G</math> is termed '''cofactorial automorphism-invariant''' if <math>H</math> is invariant under every automorphism <math>\sigma</math> of <math>G</math> such that <math>\sigma</math> has finite order, and every prime divisor of the order of <math>\sigma</math> occurs as the prime divisor of the order of some element of <math>G</math>.

===For a general group===

If the group has any element of infinite order, we define '''cofactorial automorphism-invariant''' to be the same as [[defining ingredient::characteristic subgroup]].

===For a p-group===

If <math>G</math> is a [[p-group]] for some prime <math>p</math> (in the finite case, this means <math>G</math> is a [[group of prime power order]], in the infinite case it simply means that every element has order a power of <math>p</math>), a cofactorial automorphism-invariant subgroup is the same as a [[p-automorphism-invariant subgroup]].

==Formalisms==

{{frexp}}

* The property of being a cofactorial automorphism-invariant subgroup can be expressed as an {{invariance property}}:

[[Cofactorial automorphism]] <math>\to</math> Function

In other words, <math>H</math> is cofactorial automorphism-invariant in <math>G</math> if every cofactorial automorphism of <math>G</math> restricts to a function from <math>H</math> to itself.

* This can be written as an [[endo-invariance property]]:

[[Cofactorial automorphism]] <math>\to</math> [[Endomorphism]]

In other words, <math>H</math> is cofactorial automorphism-invariant in <math>G</math> if every cofactorial automorphism of <math>G</math> restricts to an endomorphism of <math>H</math>.

* Since the inverse of an automorphism has the same order as that automorphism, and [[restriction of automorphism to subgroup invariant under it and its inverse is automorphism]] this can be further strengthened to an [[auto-invariance property]]:

[[Cofactorial automorphism]] <math>\to</math> [[Automorphism]]

In other words, <math>H</math> is cofactorial automorphism-invariant in <math>G</math> if every cofactorial automorphism of <math>G</math> restricts to an automorphism of <math>H</math>.

* The trivial subgroup is a complemented normal subgroup in any group, with the complement being the whole group.

===Examples in abelian groups===

If the whole group is an abelian group, being a complemented normal subgroup is equivalent to being a [[direct factor]], i.e., a part of an [[internal direct product]].

===General examples===

* '''Low occurrence''': A [[splitting-simple group]] is a nontrivial group with no proper nontrivial complemented normal subgroup. Any [[simple group]] is splitting-simple, but there exist splitting-simple groups that are not simple.

==Definition==

===Symbol-free definition===

A [[group]] is said to be '''complete''' if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:

* It is [[centerless group|centerless]] and every [[automorphism]] of it is [[inner automorphism|inner]].
* The natural homomorphism to the automorphism group, that sends each element to the conjugation via that element, is an isomorphism.
* Whenever it is embedded as a [[normal subgroup]] inside a bigger group, it is actually a [[direct factor]] inside that bigger group.

===Definition with symbols===

A [[group]] <math>G</math> is said to be '''complete''' if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:

* <math>Z(G)</math> (the [[center]] of <math>G</math>) is trivial and <math>\operatorname{Inn}(G) = \operatorname{Aut}(G)</math> (i.e., every automorphism of <math>G</math> is inner)
* The natural homomorphism <math>G \to \operatorname{Aut}(G)</math> given by <math>g \mapsto c_g</math> (where <math>c_g = x \mapsto gxg^{-1}</math>) is an isomorphism
* For any embedding of <math>G</math> as a [[normal subgroup]] of some group <math>K</math>, <math>G</math> is a [[direct factor]] of <math>K</math>

==Examples==

===Extreme examples===

* The [[trivial group]] is complete.

==Definition==

A '''complete map''' from a group <math>G</math> to itself is a bijection <math>\varphi:G \to G</math> such that the map <math>g \mapsto g \varphi(g)</math> is also a bijection.

Note that if <math>\alpha</math> is an [[automorphism]] of <math>G</math>, the map <math>g \mapsto \alpha(g^{-1})</math> is a complete map if and only if <math>\alpha</math> is a [[fixed-point-free automorphism]].

{{binary subgroup property operator}}

==Definition==

===Definition with symbols===

Given two subgroup properties <math>p</math> and <math>q</math>, the composition operator applied to these properties, denoted as <math>p * q</math>, is the property defined as follows: <math>H</math> has the property <math>p * q</math> as a subgroup of <math>G</math> if there is an intermediate subgroup <math>K</math> such that <math>H</math> satisfies <math>p</math> as a subgroup of <math>K</math> and <math>K</math> satisfies <math>q</math> as a subgroup of <math>G</math>.

==Property theory==

===Associativity===

Given subgroup properties <math>p</math>, <math>q</math>, and <math>r</math>, the following relation holds:

<math>(p * q) * r = p * (q * r)</math>

In other words, the composition operator is [[associativity|associative]].

===Quantalic nature===

The composition operator is a monotone operator in both arguments, when the properties are given the usual partial order of implication. Further, it distributes over logical disjunction, and is hence a [[quantalic property operator]].

===Identity element===

The identity element for the composition operator is the property of being the [[improper subgroup]], that is, of being the group embedded as a subgroup in itself. Any property that is implied by this property is termed an [[identity-true subgroup property]].

===Nil element===

The nil element for the composition operator is the [[fallacy]] subgroup property, that is the subgroup property that is ''never'' satisfied.

===Transiters===

Since the composition operator is an associative quantalic property operator, the [[Transiter master theorem]] is applicable to it, and we can talk of [[left transiter]]s, [[right transiter]]s. We can also talk of the [[subordination]] with respect to this operator.

==Definition==

===Symbol-free definition===

A [[group]] is said to be '''composition series-unique''' if it has a unique [[defining ingredient::composition series]]. In the case of a finite group, this can be expressed inductively as saying that that group is [[one-headed group|one-headed]] and that the ''head'' (viz the unique maximal normal subgroup) is itself composition series-unique.

{{semistddef}}

==Definition==

===Definition with symbols===

A [[subgroup]] <math>H</math> of a [[group]] <math>G</math> is termed '''compressed''' if for any subgroup <math>K</math> of <math>G</math> containing <math>H</math>, the [[rank of a group|rank]] of <math>H</math> is not more than the rank of <math>K</math>.

We typically study compressed subgroups inside a [[free group]].

===In terms of the intermediately operator===

The subgroup property of being compressed is obtained by applying the [[intermediately operator]] to the subgroup property of being a [[rank-dominated subgroup]]. A subgroup is said to be rank-dominated in a group if the rank of the subgroup is not more than the rank of the group.

==Relation with other properties==

===Stronger properties===

* [[Inert subgroup]]

===Weaker properties===

* [[Finite-index-maximal subgroup]] in case we are working within a [[free group]]

==Metaproperties==

===Transitivity===

It is not clear whether any compressed subgroup of a compressed subgroup is compressed. The problem lies with the fact that intermediate subgroups containing the smaller subgroup may not be comparable either way with the bigger subgroup.

{{intsubcondn}}

If a subgroup is compressed in terms of the whole group, it is clearly compressed in every intermediate subgroup.

{{trim}}

Clearly, the trivial subgroup is compressed in any group, because it is generated by zero elements. Also, every group is compressed as a subgroup of itself.

==Definition==

A '''Con-Cos group''' is a [[group]] <math>G</math> with a normal subgroup <math>N</math> satisfying the following two conditions:

* Any two non-identity elements of <math>N</math> are conjugate in <math>G</math>.
* Every non-identity coset of <math>N</math> in <math>G</math> is a [[conjugacy class]] in <math>G</math>.

Note that if <math>G</math> is an [[abelian group]], we can set <math>N</math> to be the [[trivial group|trivial subgroup]].

==Definition==

===Symbol-free definition===

A '''congruence on a group''' is an equivalence relation on the elements of the group that is compatible with all the group operations.

===Definition with symbols===

A congruence on a group <math>G</math> is an equivalence relation <math>\equiv</math> on <math>G</math> such that:

* <math>a \equiv b \implies a^{-1} \equiv b^{-1}</math>
* <math>a \equiv b, c \equiv d \implies ac \equiv bd</math>

The term '''congruence''' can more generally be used for any algebra, in the theory of universal algebras. {{further|[[congruence on an algebra]]}}
==Facts==

===The congruence class of the identity element===

It is easy to see that the congruence class of the identity element is a [[normal subgroup]]. 

Conversely, given any normal subgroup, there is a unique congruence where the congruence class of the identity element is that normal subgroup. The congruence classes here are the cosets of the normal subgroup.

===The quotient map for a congruence===

Given a congruence on a group, there is a natural [[quotient map]] from the group to the set of congruence classes. Under this map, the set of congruence classes inherits a group structure. This is termed the quotient group.

<section begin=main/>
==Definition==

===Symbol-free definition===
A '''conjugacy class''' in a [[group]] can be defined in any of the following ways:

* It is an [[Defining ingredient::orbit]] of the group (as a set) under the [[group acts as automorphisms by conjugation|action of the group on itself by conjugation]] (or as [[Defining ingredient::inner automorphism]]s)
* It is an equivalence class under the equivalence relation of being [[Defining ingredient::conjugate elements|conjugate]]

===Definition with symbols===

Suppose <math>G</math> is a [[group]]. A '''conjugacy class''' in <math>G</math> is a nonempty [[subset of a group|subset]] <math>c</math> of <math>G</math> such that the following two conditions hold:

* Given any <math>x,y \in c</math>, there exists <math>g \in G</math> such that <math>gxg^{-1} = y</math>.
* If <math>x \in c</math> and <math>g \in G</math> then <math>gxg^{-1} \in c</math>.

In other words, it is closed under the [[group acts as automorphisms by conjugation|action of the group on itself by conjugation]], and the action is transitive when restricted to the conjugacy class. In the language of group actions, it is a single orbit under the action of the group on itself by conjugation.

Any group is a disjoint union of conjugacy classes.

==Examples==

{{quotation|''If you're interested in conjugacy classes in a particular group, go to the article on that group, and look at the subsection titled '''Under conjugation''' in the section titled '''Elements'''.''}}

* In an Abelian group, all the conjugacy classes are singleton sets of size 1. That's because for any <math>x,g</math>, we have <math>gxg^{-1} = x</math>
* More generally, for any group <math>G</math>, and any element in the [[center]] of <math>G</math>, the conjugacy class of that element has size 1.
* The [[symmetric group:S3|symmetric group on three letters]] is the smallest non-Abelian group. This group has three conjugacy classes, the class of the identity element (size 1), the class of the transpositions (size 3) and the class of the 3-cycles (size 2).
* More generally, in the symmetric group on any set, two permutations are in the same conjugacy class if and only if they have the same cycle type. {{further|[[Cycle type determines conjugacy class]]}}

==Facts==

* The size of any conjugacy class divides the order of the group, for a [[finite group]]. More precisely, it is the index of the centralizer of any element of the conjugacy class. This follows from the more general fact that the size of any orbit under a group action is the index of the stabilizer of any point in the orbit. {{further|[[size of conjugacy class divides order of group]], [[size of conjugacy class divides index of center]]}}
* A conjugacy class has size 1 iff the corresponding element is in the [[center]].
* The sizes of the conjugacy classes are related by a [[class equation]]
* The set of conjugacy classes can be given an algebraic structure in various ways; for instance, the [[convolution algebra on conjugacy classes]]
* For a finite group <math>G</math>, given a conjugacy class <math>c</math> and a natural number <math>n</math> which divides the order of the group, the number of solutions to <math>x^n \in c</math> is a multiple of <math>n</math>

==History==

The term was first used in the paper ''Transfer and fusion in finite groups'' by Alperin and Gorenstein in the Journal of Algebra, 6 (1967), Pages 242-255.

==Definition==

===Definition with symbols===

Let <math>G</math> be a group and <math>p</math> a prime. A '''conjugacy functor''' is a map <math>W</math> from the collection of nontrivial <math>p</math>-subgroups of <math>G</math> to the collection of nontrivial <math>p</math>-subgroups of <math>G</math> that satisfies:

* For any <math>p</math>-subgroup <math>H</math>, <math>W(H) \le H</math>.
* For any <math>p</math>-subgroup <math>H</math>, and any <math>x \in G</math>, <math>xW(H)x^{-1} = W(xHx^{-1})</math>.

===Examples===

Examples of conjugacy functors include the identity mapping, the functors corresponding to different possible [[Thompson subgroup]]s, and the [[ZJ-functor]].

Note also that any [[central functor]] is a conjugacy functor. Also, every [[characteristic p-functor]] is a conjugacy functor.

* Every [[class automorphism]] of the whole group restricts to a class automorphism of the subgroup (a class automorphism is an [[automorphism]] that sends each element to within its [[conjugacy class]]).

* Every [[inner automorphism]] of the whole group restricts to a class automorphism of the subgroup.

if <math>H</math> is conjugacy-closed normal in <math>K</math> and <math>K</math> is conjugacy-closed normal in <math>G</math>, then <math>H</math> is conjugacy-closed normal in <math>G</math>.

===Intersection-closedness===

It is not clear whether the intersection of two conjugacy-closed normal subgroups is conjugacy-closed normal.

Clearly, every group is conjugacy-closed normal as a subgroup of itself. Further, the trivial subgroup is also clearly conjugacy-closed normal in the whole group.

If <math>H</math> is conjugacy-closed normal in <math>G</math>, it is also conjugacy-closed normal in every intermediate subgroup <math>K</math>. This follows from these two facts:

==Origin==

The notion of conjugacy-closed subgroup was introduced in a journal article in the 1950s.

==Definition==

===Symbol-free definition===

A subgroup of a group is termed '''conjugacy-closed''' if any two elements of the subgroup that are conjugate in the whole group are also conjugate in the subgroup. A conjugacy-closed subgroup is also sometimes termed '''c-closed''', but now [[c-closed subgroup]] has a different meaning.

===Definition with symbols===

A subgroup <math>H</math> of a group <math>G</math> is termed '''conjugacy-closed''' if given <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> in <math>H</math> such that there is <math>g</math> in <math>G</math> satisfying <math>gxg^{-1} = y</math>, then there is an <math>h</math> in <math>H</math> satisfying <math>hxh^{-1} = y</math>.

A related term is '''fusion'''. Two elements of a subgroup are said to fuse in the whole group if they become conjugate in the whole group. A subgroup is conjugacy-closed, essentially if no further fusion occurs when passing from the subgroup to the whole group.

The property of being conjugacy-closed arises via the [[relation restriction formalism]] with both the left and right properties being the equivalence relation of being conjugate.

==Relation with other properties==

===Conjunction with other properties===

* [[Weaker than::Conjugacy-closed normal subgroup]]
* [[Weaker than::Sylow retract]]: This is the conjunction with the property of being a [[Sylow subgroup]]. It turns out that a conjugacy-closed Sylow subgroup must be a retract (i.e., possesses a normal complement). {{proofat|[[Conjugacy-closed and Sylow implies retract]]}}

===Stronger properties===

* [[Weaker than::Direct factor]]
* [[Weaker than::Central factor]]
* [[Weaker than::Retract]]: {{proofofstrictimplicationat|[[Retract implies conjugacy-closed]]|[[Conjugacy-closed not implies retract]]}} However, for a [[Sylow subgroup]], the property of being a retract and being a conjugacy-closed subgroup are equivalent. {{proofat|[[Conjugacy-closed and Sylow implies retract]]}}

===Incomparable properties===

* [[Conjugate-dense subgroup]]: A subgroup is conjugate-dense if any element of the group is conjugate to some element of the subgroup. There is a close relation between conjugacy-closed subgroups and conjugate-dense subgroups, even though neither property implies the other.

===General linear groups over subfields are conjugacy-closed===

{{further|[[general linear group over subfield is conjugacy-closed]]}}

This is a typical context in which conjugacy-closedness comes up in representation theory. Let <math>k</math> be a subfield of <math>K</math>. Then, we get a natural embedding of <math>Gl_n(k)</math> in <math>GL_n(K)</math>.

It turns out that for this embedding, <math>GL_n(k)</math> is a conjugacy-closed subgroup of <math>GL_n(K)</math>. The proof relies on basic facts in linear algebra, and is often used implicitly or explicitly in proofs, when we simply talk of two linear transformations being "conjugate" without specifying whether we are thinking of them as conjugate in the smaller field or in the bigger field.

===Symmetric group is conjugacy-closed in the general linear group===

{{further|[[Brauer's permutation lemma]]}}

This is again a deep and important fact, true only when the field has characteristic zero.

===Symmetric groups on subsets are conjugacy-closedness===
{{further|[[Symmetric group on subset is conjugacy-closed]]}}
Suppose <math>A</math> is a subset of <math>B</math>. Then, the symmetric group of <math>A</math> embeds inside the symmetric group on <math>B</math>, and under this embedding, it is a conjugacy-closed subgroup. This follows from the fact that [[cycle type determines conjugacy class]] for a permutation.
===A general strategy to proving conjugacy-closedness===

{{further|[[Proving conjugacy-closedness]]}}

The following is a general strategy to showing that a subgroup <math>H</math> is conjugacy-closed in a group <math>G</math>. We find a subgroup <math>K</math> of <math>H</matH> such that:

* <math>K</math> is [[conjugate-dense subgroup|conjugate-dense]] in <math>H</math>
* Any two elements of <math>K</math> which are conjugate in <math>G</math>, are in fact conjugate in <math>H</math>

More generally, <math>K</math> need not even be a subgroup; we need to find a subset of <math>H</math> such that the union of its conjugates is <math>H</math>, and such that any two elements of the subset which are conjugate in <math>G</math>, are conjugate in <math>H</math>.

==Metaproperties==

{{transitive}}

Any conjugacy-closed subgroup of a conjugacy-closed subgroup is conjugacy-closed. This follows from the fact that conjugacy-closedness is a [[balanced subgroup property]] with respect to the relation restriction formalism.
{{proofat|[[Conjugacy-closedness is transitive]]}}

{{trim}}

* The property of being conjugacy-closed is [[trivially true subgroup property|trivially true]], that is, the trivial subgroup is always conjugacy-closed.
* The property of being conjugacy-closed is [[identity-true subgroup property|identity-true]], that is, the whole group is conjugacy-closed as a subgroup of itself.

===Intersection-closedness===

It is not clear whether an intersection of conjugacy-closed subgroups is conjugacy-closed.

{{intsubcondn}}

The property of being conjugacy-closed satisfies the [[intermediate subgroup condition]]. This is because the equivalence relation of being conjugate in a smaller subgroup implies the equivalence relation of being conjugate in the whole group. {{proofat|[[Conjugacy-closedness satisfies intermediate subgroup condition]]}}

{{not upper join-closed}}

If <math>H \le G</math> and <math>K_1, K_2</math> are intermediate subgroups of <math>G</math> containing <math>H</math>, such that <math>H</math> is conjugacy-closed in both <math>K_1</math> and <math>K_2</math>, then <math>H</math> need not be conjugacy-closed in the join <math>\langle K_1, K_2 \rangle</math>. {{proofat|[[Conjugacy-closedness is not upper join-closed]]}}

==Definition==

===Symbol-free definition===

A [[subgroup]] of a [[group]] is said to be '''conjugate-dense''' if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:

* The union of all conjugates of the subgroup in the group, is the whole group
* Every element in the whole group is conjugate to some element in the subgroup
* Every cyclic subgroup of the whole group is conjugate to a cyclic subgroup of the given subgroup. In other words, it ''dominates'' all cyclic subgroups
* For the action of the whole group on the [[coset space]], every element of the group has a fixed point.
===Definition with symbols===

A [[subgroup]] <math>H</math> of a [[group]] <math>G</math> is termed '''conjugate-dense''' in <math>G</math> if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:

* <math>\bigcup_{g \in G} gHg^{-1} = G</math>
* For any <math>a \in G</math>, there exists <math>b \in G</math> such that <math>bab^{-1} \in H</math>
* For every cyclic subgroup <math>C \le G</math>, there exists <math>b \in G</math> such that <math>bCb^{-1} \le H</math>
* Under the natural action of <math>G</math> on the coset space <math>G/H</math>, every <math>g \in G</math> has a fixed point.

==Relation with other properties==

===Weaker properties===

* [[Contranormal subgroup]]: Here, we only require that the [[normal closure]] should be the whole group. Note that the normal closure may, in general be much bigger than the union of conjugates.

===Incomparable properties===

* [[Finite-dominating subgroup]]
===Opposite properties===

* [[Subgroup of finite index]]: It turns out that there cannot be a conjugate-dense subgroup of finite index other than the whole group. {{proofat|[[Union of all conjugates is proper]]}}
* [[Normal subgroup]]: Clearly, the only normal conjugate-dense subgroup is the whole group

==Importance==

The general context in which being conjugate-dense is important is as follows. Suppose <math>M</math> is a set with some additional structure, and <math>G</math> is the group of automorphisms with that additional structure. This <math>G</math> could in principle be very huge, and unmanageable. Now suppose adding some ''further'' structure to <math>M</math> causes the automorphism group to reduce to a much smaller subgroup <math>H</math> of <math>G</math>.

In principle we could lose a lot of the symmetry in <math>G</math> when we pass to <math>H</math>. Thus, we are often interested in the question: when can we guarantee that every <math>g \in G</math> is conjugate (in <math>G</math>) to some element of <math>H</math>? In other words, is <math>H</math> conjugate-dense in <math>G</math>? If the answer to this question is ''yes'', then that means that at least if we are looking at only one element of <math>G</math> at a time, then we might safely assume that our element is in <math>H</math>.

Examples of passage to additional structure are:

* Giving a differential structure to a topological manifold
* Giving a Riemannian structure to a topological or differential manifold (typically, the isometry group of a Riemannian manifold is far from conjugate-dense in the group of diffeomorphisms or homeomorphisms)
* Giving a linear or piecewise linear structure (or a simplicial structure) to a topological manifold

The importance of [[finite-dominating subgroup]]s is for similar reasons.

==Examples==

For a full list of examples, refer:

[[:Category:Instances of conjugate-dense subgroups]]

* The subgroup of upper triangular matrices, viz the [[Borel subgroup]] <math>B(n,\mathbb{C})</math>, is conjugate-dense in <math>GL(n,\mathbb{C})</math>: in other words, every invertible matrix is conjugate to an upper triangular matrix (the analogous result does not hold for a non-algebraically closed field, and in particular, it doesn't hold for any finite field). {{further|[[Triangulability theorem]]}}
* The statement that every element of <math>SO(3,\R)</math> is a rotation about some axis (called [[Euler's theorem]]) can be rephrased as saying that <math>SO(2,\R)</math> is conjugate-dense in <math>SO(3,\R)</math> {{further|[[Euler's theorem]]}}

==Metaproperties==

{{transitive}}

If <math>H \le K \le G</math> are subgroups such that <math>K</math> is the union of conjugates of <math>H</math> within <math>K</math>, and <math>G</math> is the union of conjugates of <math>K</math> within <math>G</math>, then:

Every conjugate of <math>K</math> within <math>G</math> is expressible as a union of conjugates of <math>H</math> within <math>G</math>.

This forces <math>H</math> to be conjugate-dense in <math>G</math>. {{proofat|[[Conjugate-denseness is transitive]]}}

===Trimness===

The property of being conjugate-dense can be satisfied by the trivial subgroup only if the whole group is trivial. However, it is always satisfied by the whole group, hence it is {{i-true}}.

===Intermediate subgroup condition===

The property of being conjugate-dense probably does not satisfy the intermediate subgroup condition.

==History==

===Origin===

{{term introduced by|Tuval Foguel}}

Both the term and the concept of conjugate-permutable subgroups arose in the paper ''Conjugate-permutable subgroups'' by Tuval Foguel. Foguel introduced this notion by observing that the proof that [[permutable subgroup]]s are [[subnormal subgroup|subnormal]] actually generalizes to showing that conjugate-permutable subgroups are subnormal (in finite groups).

==Definition==

===Symbol-free definition===

A subgroup of a group is termed '''conjugate-permutable''' if it [[Defining ingredient::permuting subgroups|permutes]] with every [[Defining ingredient::conjugate subgroups|conjugate]] of itself, or equivalently, if its [[Defining ingredient::product of subgroups|product]] with every conjugate of it is a subgroup.

===Definition with symbols===

A subgroup <math>H</math> of a group <math>G</math> is termed '''conjugate-permutable''' if <math>HH^g = H^gH</math> for all <math>g</math> in <math>G</math>, or equivalently, if <math>HH^g</math> is a group for all <math>g</math> in <math>G</math>.

(here <math>H^g = g^{-1}Hg</math> is a conjugate subgroup to <math>H</math> in <math>G</math>).

==Formalisms==
{{wikilocal-section}}
{{first-order subgroup property}}

A subgroup <math>H</math> is conjugate-permutable in a group <math>G</math> if the following first-order sentence is satisfied:

<math>\forall g \in G, \forall x,y \in H \exists a,b \in H . (xgyg^{-1} = gag^{-1}b)</math>

{{riexp}}
The property of being conjugate-permutable can be encoded as [[conjugate subgroups]] <math>\implies</math> [[permuting subgroups]]. In other words <math>H</math> is conjugate-permutable in <math>G</math> iff any conjugate subgroup to <math>H</math>, permutes with <math>H</math>.

{{obtainedbyapplyingthe|permutability operator|conjugate subgroups}}
The property of being conjugate-permutable is obtained by applying the [[permutability operator]] to the subgroup pair property of being [[conjugate subgroups|conjugate]].

==History==

{{history missing}}

==Definition==

===Symbol-free definition===

A [[subgroup]] of a [[group]] is contranormal if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:

* Its [[normal closure]] (i.e. the smallest [[normal subgroup]] containing it) in the group is the whole group
* There is no proper subgroup of the whole group, containing every conjugate of the given subgroup

===Definition with symbols===

A [[subgroup]] <math>H</math> of a [[group]] <math>G</math> is termed '''contranormal''' in <math>G</math> if the normal closure <math>H^G</math> is equal to <math>G</math>.

Note that this is ''not'' equivalent to saying that every element of <math>G</math> is conjugate to an element of <math>H</math>: that property is termed being a [[conjugate-dense subgroup]].

Every [[maximal subgroup]] is either normal or contranormal.

==Formalisms==

{{monadic second-order subgroup property}}

A subgroup <math>H</math> in a group <math>G</math> is contranormal if it satisfies the following monadic second-order condition:

<math>\forall A \subset G, [(x \in H, g \in G \implies gxg^{-1} \in A) \land (x,y \in A \implies xy^{-1} \in A)] \implies A = G</math>

We are essentially using the fact that the [[normal closure]] has a monadic second-order description.

===Incomparable properties===

* [[Self-normalizing subgroup]]: Though these are closely related, neither implies the other. {{proofat|[[Self-normalizing not implies contranormal]], [[contranormal not implies self-normalizing]]}}
* [[Core-free subgroup]]: Though these are closely related, neither implies the other. This is easily observed from the fact that core-freeness is a notion of being ''small'' while self-normalizing is a notion of being ''big''.

==Facts==

===The descendant-contranormal factorization===

Every subgroup of a group can be expressed as a contranormal subgroup of a [[descendant subgroup]]. For a subgroup <math>H</math>, each term of the descending serise is the normal closuer of <math>H</math> inside its predecessor.

==Metaproperties==

{{transitive}}

If <math>G \le H \le K</math> and each is contravariant in the next, then <math>G</math> is contranormal in <math>K</math>. The proof of this follows from the fact that the normal closure of <math>G</math> in <math>K</math> can be obtained by first taking the normal  closure of <math>G</math> in <math>H</math>, and then again of <math>H</math> in <math>K</math>.

{{upward-closed}}

Any subgroup containing a contranormal subgroup is contranormal. This follows from the fact that the normal closure of a bigger subgroup contains the normal closure of a smaller subgroup.

===Intermediate subgroup condition===

Contranormality does not satisfy the intermediate subgroup condition. It seems possible that every subgroup is [[potentially operator|potentially]] contranormal, though a proof is not immediate.

{{NCI}}

The only normal contranormal subgroup of a group is the whole group.

{{not intersection-closed}}

An intersection of contranormal subgroups need not be contranormal. This follows from the fact that contranormality is an [[NCI-subgroup property]].

==Effect of property operators==

{{applyingoperatorgives|intermediately operator|weakly abnormal subgroup}}

If <math>H \le G</math> is a subgroup such that <math>H</math> is contranormal in every intermediate subgroup <math>K</math>, then <math>H</math> is termed a weakly abnormal subgroup of <math>G</math>.

==Testing==

{{GAP code for subgroup property|test = IsContranormal}}

While there is no built-in GAP command for testing contranormality, this can be accomplished by a short piece of GAP code, available at [[GAP:IsContranormal]]. The command is invoked as follows:

<pre>IsContranormal(group,subgroup);</pre>

==Definition==

The group, denoted <math>\operatorname{Co}_1</math>, is defined as the [[inner automorphism group]] of <math>\operatorname{Co}_0</math> (see [[defining ingredient::Conway group:Co0]]), which in turn is defined as the [[automorphism group of a Euclidean lattice|automorphism group]] of the [[defining ingredient::Leech lattice]].

Note that <math>\operatorname{Co}_0</math> has a [[center]] which is isomorphic to [[cyclic group:Z2]], with the non-identity element corresponding to the automorphism given by sending every vector to its negative. Thus, <math>\operatorname{Co}_1</math> is the [[quotient group]] of <math>\operatorname{Co}_0</math> by a subgroup of order two.

The group is a finite [[simple non-abelian group]], and in fact, it is one of the 26 [[sporadic simple group]]s. It is also one of the three [[defining ingredient::Conway group]]s.

Since the subgroup intersects the center of [[Conway group:Co0]] trivially, it can also be viewed as a subgroup of [[Conway group:Co1]], which is the [[inner automorphism group]] of the [[Conway group:Co0]].

This is a finite [[simple non-abelian group]] that is one of the 26 [[sporadic simple group]]s, and is also one of the three [[defining ingredient::Conway group]]s.

===Symbol-free definition===

A [[subgroup]] of a [[group]] is termed core-free if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:

* Its [[normal core]] (viz the intersection of al its conjugates) is trivial
* The action of the group on the [[coset space]] is effective (that is, every element of the group acts nontrivially on the coset space)

===Definition with symbols===

A subgroup <math>H</math> of a group <math>G</math> is termed ''core-free'' if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:

* <math>\bigcap_x xHx^{-1}</math> is the trivial subgroup.
* The action of <math>G</math> by left multiplication on the [[coset space]] <math>G/H</math> is effective, that is, for every <math>g \in G</math>, there is a coset <math>xH</math> such that <math>g(xH) \ne xH</math>.

==Formalisms==

A subgroup <math>H</math> is core-free in a group <math>G</math> if:

<math>\forall x \in H . (\forall g \in G, gxg^{-1} \in H), x = e</math>

Essentially, we are using the fact that the [[normal core]] can be described using a first-order condition.

===Stronger properties===

* Proper [[malnormal subgroup]]
* Proper [[TI-subgroup]]

==Facts==

Given a subgroup <math>H</math> of <math>G</math>, <math>G</math> acts transitively on the coset space of <math>H</math>.

Conversely any transitive group action can be modelled as an action on the coset space of a subgroup.

Thus, we have the following:

<math>G</math> has a core-free subgroup of index <math>n</math> if and only if it can be embedded as a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group on <math>n</math> elements.


==Metaproperties==

===Lower hereditariness===

Core-freeness is a [[lower hereditary property]], that is, any subgroup of a core-free subgroup is again core-free. Moreover, the [[trivial subgroup]] is always core-free.

From lower hereditariness, it follows that core-freeness is transitive and that an intersection of core-free subgroups is core-free.

===Upper hereditariness===

Core-freeness is also upper hereditary: any core-free subgroup of a subgroup is core-free in the whole group.

A presentation of this kind is termed a '''Coxeter presentation'''. Often, the term ''Coxeter group'' is used for the group along with a ''specific choice'' of Coxeter presentation.

===Definition with symbols===

A [[group]] <math>G</math> is termed a '''Coxeter group''' if it can be equipped with a finite presentation with generators <math>s_i</math> and relations:

* <math>s_i^2 = 1</math>
* <math>(s_is_j)^{m_{ij}} = 1</math> where <math>m_{ij}</math> is a symmetric function of <math>i</math> and <math>j</math> (for distinct <math>i</math> and <math>j</math>)
 
Alternatively we can consider a symmetric matrix <math>m_{ij}</math> with the diagonal entries being <math>1</math> and simply require that for each <math>i</math> and <math>j</math> (not necessarily distinct) <math>(s_is_j)^{m_{ij}} = 1</math>. Note that we allow the entries <math>m_{ij}</math> to be <math>0</math>.

Such a presentation is termed a '''Coxeter presentation''' and the matrix of <math>m_{ij}</math>s is termed a '''Coxeter matrix'''. Often, the term ''Coxeter group'' is used for a Coxeter group along with a ''specific choice'' of Coxeter presentation.

A direct product of Coxeter groups is a Coxeter group. The Coxeter matrix for the direct product is obtained by taking the block concatenation of the Coxeter matrices for the individual groups and then replacing the off-diagonal zero blocks by blocks with all entries equal to 2.

==Definition==

===Symbol-free definition===

A [[subgroup]] of a [[group of prime power order]] (or more generally, of a possibly infinite [[p-group]]) is termed a '''critical subgroup''' if it is [[characteristic subgroup|characteristic]] in the whole group and satisfies the following three conditions:

# The subgroup is a [[Frattini-in-center group]]: Its [[Frattini subgroup]] is contained in its [[center]].
# The subgroup is a [[commutator-in-center subgroup]]: Its [[commutator of two subgroups|commutator]] with the whole group is contained in its center.
# The subgroup is a [[self-centralizing subgroup]]: Its [[centralizer]] in the whole group is contained in it.
===Definition with symbols===

Let <math>G</math> be a [[group of prime power order]] (or more generally, a possibly infinite [[p-group]]).

A subgroup <math>H</math> of <math>G</math> is said to be '''critical''' if it is [[defining ingredient::characteristic subgroup|characteristic]] in <math>G</math>, and the following three conditions hold:

# <math>\Phi(H) \le Z(H)</math>, i.e., the [[Frattini subgroup]] is contained inside the [[center]] (i.e., <math>H</math> is a [[defining ingredient::Frattini-in-center group]]).
# <math>[G,H] \le Z(H)</math> (i.e., <math>H</math> is a [[defining ingredient::commutator-in-center subgroup]] of <math>G</math>).
# <math>C_G(H)= Z(H)</math> (i.e., <math>H</math> is a [[self-centralizing subgroup]] of <math>G</math>).

===Equivalence of definitions===

{{further|[[Equivalence of definitions of cyclic group]]}}

The second and third definition are equivalent because the subgroup generated by an element is precisely the set of its powers. The first definition is equivalent to the other two, because:

* The image of <math>1 \in \mathbb{Z}</math> under a surjective homomorphism from <math>\mathbb{Z}</math> to <math>G</math> must generate <math>G</math>
* Conversely, if an element <math>g</math> generates <math>G</math>, we get a surjective homomorphism <math>\mathbb{Z} \to G</math> by <math>n \mapsto g^n</math>

The cyclic group of order 2 is defined as the unique group of order two. Explicitly it can be described as a group with two elements, say <math>e</math> and <math>x</math> such that <math>ex = xe = x</math> and <math>e^2 = x^2 = e</math>. It can also be viewed as:

* The [[quotient group]] of the group of integers by the subgroup of even integers
* The multiplicative group comprising <math>1</math> and <math>-1</math> (in this context it is also termed the sign group)
* The additive group of the [[field:F2|field of two elements]].
* Bits under the XOR operation
* The {{symmetric group}} on two elements. In particular, it is a [[member of family::symmetric group on finite set]] and [[member of family::symmetric group of prime degree]].
* The {{general linear group}} <math>GL(1,3)</math> (or equivalently, the [[member of family::multiplicative group of a field|multiplicative group]] of the field of order 3)
* The multiplicative group of the ring <math>\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}</math>
* The group of units in <math>\mathbb{Z}</math>
* The group <math>S^0(\R)</math> viz., the group of vectors in <math>\R^1</math> of unit length

This group is denoted as <math>C_2</math>, <math>\mathbb{Z}_2</math> and sometimes as <math>\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}</math>.

==Endomorphisms==

===Automorphisms===

The cyclic group of order two has no nontrivial automorphisms. In fact, it is the only nontrivial group with the property of having no nontrivial automorphisms. {{further|[[trivial automorphism group implies trivial or order two]]}}

===Endomorphisms===

The cyclic group of order two admits two endomorphisms: the identity map and the trivial map (the map sending both elements to the identity element).

==Subgroup structure==

===Subgroups===

There are only two subgroups: the trivial subgroup and the whole group. Most of the ''nice'' subgroup properties are true for both.

===Quotients===

There are only two quotients: itself and the trivial quotient.

==Supergroups==

{{further|[[supergroups of cyclic group:Z2]]}}

===Occurrence as a subgroup===

The cyclic group of order 2 occurs as a subgroup in many groups. In general, any group of even order contains a cyclic subgroup of order 2 (this follows from [[Cauchy's theorem]], which is a corollary of [[Sylow's theorem]], though it can also be proved by a direct counting argument). Elements of order 2, which are generators for cyclic groups of order 2, are termed [[involution]]s.

===Occurrence as a normal subgroup===

The cyclic group of order 2 may occur as a normal subgroup in some groups. Examples are the [[general linear group]] or [[special linear group]] over a field whose characteristic is not 2. This is the group comprising the identity and negative identity matrix.

It is also true that a normal subgroup of order two is [[central subgroup|central]]. More generally, it is true that [[normal of least prime order implies central|a normal subgroup whose order is the least prime divisor of the order of the group is central]]. Thus, the existence of normal subgroups of order two indicates a nontrivial center.

Viewed another way, given a group <math>G</math>, it often happens that we can find a group <math>H</math> with a surjective homomorphism to <math>G</math> whose kernel is a cyclic group of order 2. In some cases, the [[Schur multiplier]] of the group is the cyclic group of order <math>2</math>. An example is the [[projective special linear group]], whose Schur multiplier has order two and the [[universal central extension]] is the special linear group.

===Occurrence as a quotient group===

The cyclic group of order 2 occurs very often as a quotient. Put another way, given a group, we can often find a [[subgroup of index two]]. Any subgroup of index two is normal (more generally, any [[subgroup of least prime index is normal]]).

In these cases, the group of order two may or may not occur as a complement to the normal subgroup. Examples where it ''does'' occur as a complement are the [[alternating group]] in the [[symmetric group]], or <math>GL^+(n,\R)</math> in <math>GL(n,\R)</math>.

Viewed another way, given a group <math>G</math>, we may often be able to construct a group <math>H</math> in which <math>G</math> has index two.

==Families==

The cyclic group of order two lies in the family of [[cyclic group]]s, of [[general linear group]]s, and of [[symmetric group]]s.

It also lies in the family of sphere groups: namely, it is the group of unit vectors in <math>\R^1</math>. The other two sphere groups are <math>S^0(\mathbb{C}) = S^1</math> (the [[circle group]]) and <math>S^0(\mathbb{H}) = S^3</math> (the [[unit quaternion group]]).

==Endomorphisms==

Any endomorphism of a cyclic group is determined by where it sends the generator. The cyclic group of order three has three endomorphisms:

* The identity map is an endomorphism. This map sends every element to itself.
* The square map is an endomorphism. This map sends <math>x</math> to <math>x^2</math>, <math>x^2</math> to <math>x</math>, and <math>e</math> to itself.
* The trivial map is an endomorphism. This map sends every element to <math>e</math>.

===Automorphisms===

Of the three endomorphisms, two are automorphisms: the identity map and the square map. These form a cyclic group of order two: the square map, applied twice, gives the identity map.

==Subgroups==

The group has no proper nontrivial subgroups: the only subgroups are the whole group and the trivial subgroup.

More generally, any nontrivial group with no proper nontrivial subgroup must be cyclic of prime order. Conversely, any cyclic group of prime order has no proper nontrivial subgroup. {{further|[[No proper nontrivial subgroup implies cyclic of prime order]]}}

==Quotients==

The cyclic group of order three has only two quotients: the whole group and the trivial quotient. This follows from the fact that this group is simple -- it has no proper nontrivial normal subgroup.

==Other constructions==

{{holomorph|symmetric group:S3}}

The holomorph of this group, i.e., the semidirect product of this group with its automorphism group, is isomorphic to the symmetric group on three letters. The cyclic group sits inside this as the alternating group and the automorphism group sits inside as a subgroup of order two.

==In larger groups==

===Occurrence as a subgroup===

The cyclic group of order 3 occurs as a subgroup in many groups. In general, a group contains a cyclic subgroup of order three if and only if its order is a multiple of three (this follows from [[Cauchy's theorem]], a corollary of [[Sylow's theorem]]).

===Occurrence as a normal subgroup===

The cyclic group of order three occurs as a normal subgroup in some groups.

For instance, if a field contains non-identity cuberoots of unity, then the multiplicative group of the field contains a cyclic subgroup of order three. As a corollary, the general linear group contains a central subgroup of order three.

Normal subgroups of order three need not be central; for instance, in the [[symmetric group:S3|symmetric group on three letters]], the alternating group is a normal subgroup of order three, but is not central. However, for an [[odd-order group]], any normal subgroup of order three is central. This follows from a more general fact: [[normal of least prime order implies central|a normal subgroup whose order is the least prime divisor of the order of the group is central]].

* Every [[cyclic group|cyclic]] [[subgroup]] is [[defining ingredient::normal subgroup|normal]].
* Every [[defining ingredient::inner automorphism]] is a [[defining ingredient::power automorphism]].

{{S-closed}}

Using the fact that normality satisfies the [[intermediate subgroup condition]], viz any normal subgroup of the whole group is also normal in every intermediate subgroup, we conclude that any subgroup of a Dedekind group is again a Dedekind group.

{{Q-closed}}

Using the fact that normality satisfies the [[image condition]], viz the image of any normal subgroup via a quotient map is again a normal subgroup, we conclude that any quotient of a Dedekind group is again a Dedekind group.

{{not DP-closed}}

A direct product of two Dedekind groups need not be Dedekind. One example is the direct product of the [[quaternion group]] and the [[cyclic group:Z4|cyclic group of order four]].

==Testing==

{{GAP code for gp}}

There is no GAP command to directly test whether a group is a Dedekind group, but the following GAP code can be used to define a command:

<pre>IsDedekind := function(G)
	   local H;
	   for H in List(ConjugacyClassesSubgroups(G),Representative) do
	       if not IsNormal(G,H) then return false; fi;

{{subgroup-defining function}}

==History==

The notion of derived subgroup or commutator subgroup naturally arose in the context of finding a natural choice for a good composition series for a [[solvable group]] -- solvable groups arise very naturally in the fundamental problems dealt with in Galois theory.

==Definition==

===Symbol-free definition===

The '''derived subgroup''' or '''commutator subgroup''' of a [[group]] is defined in the following equivalent ways:

# It is the subgroup generated by all [[commutator]]s of the whole group.
# It is the [[normal closure]] of the subgroup generated by all [[commutator]]s of the whole group.
# It is the intersection of all [[abelian-quotient subgroup]]s (viz., [[normal subgroup]]s with abelian quotients). In other words, it is the smallest normal subgroup for which the quotient group is abelian.

===Definition with symbols===

The '''derived subgroup''' or '''commutator subgroup''' of a [[group]] <math>G</math>, denoted as <math>[G,G]</math> or as <math>\! G'</math>, is defined in the following way:

# It is the subgroup generated by all [[commutator]]s, or elements of the form <math>[x,y] = xyx^{-1}y^{-1}</math> where <math>x,y \in G</math>.
# It is the [[normal closure]] of the subgroup generated by all elements of the form <math>[x,y]</math>.
# it is the intersection of all [[abelian-quotient subgroup]]s of <math>G</math>, viz., subgroups <math>H \underline{\triangleleft} G</math> such that <math>G/H</math> is an [[abelian group]].

===Equivalence of definitions===

{{proofat|[[Equivalence of definitions of derived subgroup]]}}

==Group properties==

It is ''not'' true that every group can be realized as the derived subgroup of another group -- for instance, the [[characteristically metacyclic and commutator-realizable implies abelian]] tells us that a group whose first two abelianizations are cyclic, but whose [[second derived subgroup]] is not trivial, cannot arise as a derived subgroup.


==Associated constructions==

{{associated qdf|Abelianization}}

The quotient of a group by its commutator subgroup is termed its Abelianization. This can also be thought of as the ''largest'' possible Abelian quotient of the group.

{{associated ds|Derived series}}

The series obtained by iterating the commutator subgroup-defining function is termed the derived series. The <math>n^{th}</math> member of this is termed the <math>n^{th}</math> derived subgroup.

A group for which this derived series terminates at the identity in finitely many steps is termed a [[solvable group]] and the length of the derived series is termed the [[derived length]].
==Examples==

===Examples where the derived subgroup is proper and nontrivial===

The '''quotient part''' in the examples below is the [[abelianization]] of the group.

{{sdf examples}}

===Examples where the derived subgroup is trivial===

These are precisely the [[abelian group]]s (follow through the link for examples).

===Examples where the derived subgroup is the whole group===

These are precisely the [[perfect group]]s (follow through the link for examples).

==Effect of operators==

===Fixed-point operator===

A group which equals its own commutator subgroup is termed a [[perfect group]]

===Free operator===

A group whose commutator subgroup is trivial is termed an [[Abelian group]]
==Subgroup-defining function properties==

{{monotone sdf}}

This follows from the fact that any commutator of elements inside a subgroup is also a commutator of elements inside the whole group.


==Computation==

===The computation problem===

{{further|[[Commutator subgroup computation problem]]}}

The general problem of computing the commutator subgroup given the whole group can be solved, when ther group is described in terms of a generating set. The idea is to take the [[normal closure]] of the subgroup generated by all commutators of elements in the generating set.

{{GAP command for sdf|DerivedSubgroup}}

To compute the commutator subgroup of a group in GAP, the syntax is:

<pre>DerivedSubgroup (group);</pre>

where <pre>group</pre> could either be an on-the-spot description of the group or a name aluding to a previously defined group.

We can assign this as a value, to a new name, for instance:

<pre>dg := DerivedSubgroup (g);</pre>

where <pre>g</pre> is the original group and <pre>dg</pre> is the derived subgroup.

* <math>H_0 = G</math>
* <math>H_{\alpha + 1} \ \underline{\triangleleft} \ H_\alpha</math> (viz <math>H_{\alpha + 1}</math> is a [[normal subgroup]] of <math>H_\alpha</math>) for every ordinal <math>\alpha</math>.

==Definition==

The '''dicyclic group''', also called the '''binary dihedral group''' with parameter <math>n</math> is defined in the following equivalent ways:

* It is given by the [[presentation]]:

<math>\langle a,x \mid a^{2n}=e, x^2 = a^n, xax^{-1} = a^{-1} \rangle</math>

Here, <math>e</math> is the identity element.

* It has the following faithful representation as a subgroup of the quaternions: <math>a = e^{i\pi/n}, x = j</math>.
* It is the [[binary von Dyck group]] with parameters <math>(n,2,2)</math>, i.e., it has the presentation:

<math>\langle a,b,c \mid a^n = b^2 = c^2 = abc \rangle</math>.

The dicyclic group with parameter <math>n</math> has order <math>4n</math>, and it is an extension of a cyclic group of order <math>2n</math> by a cyclic group of order 2.

{{group property}}

{{natural number-parametrized group family}}

==Definition==

The '''dihedral group''' of degree <math>n</math> and order <math>2n</math>, denoted sometimes as sometimes as <math>D_{2n}</math> ('''this wiki uses <math>D_{2n}</math>'''), sometimes as <math>D_n</math>, and sometimes as <math>\operatorname{Dih}_n</math>, is defined in the following equivalent ways:

* It has the [[presentation]] (here, <math>e</math> denotes the identity element):

<math>\langle x,a \mid a^n = x^2 = e, xax^{-1} = a^{-1} \rangle</math>

* (For <math>n \ge 3</math>): It is the group of symmetries of a regular <math>n</math>-gon in the plane, viz., the plane isometries that preserves the set of points of the regular <math>n</math>-gon.

The dihedral groups arise as a special case of a family of groups called [[von Dyck group]]s. They also arise as a special case of a family of groups called [[Coxeter group]]s.

Note that for <math>n = 1</math> and <math>n = 2</math>, the geometric description of the dihedral group does not make sense. In these cases, we use the algebraic description.

The [[infinite dihedral group]], which is the <math>n = \infty</math> case of the dihedral group and is denoted <math>D_\infty</math> and is defined as:

<math>\langle x,a \mid x^2 = e, xax^{-1} = a^{-1} \rangle</math>.

==Related notions==

===Generalizations===

* [[Generalized dihedral group]]: This is a semidirect product of an abelian group by a cyclic group of order two acting via the inverse map.
* [[q-hedral group]]
* [[Coxeter group]]: Dihedral groups are Coxeter groups with two generators.

==Particular cases==

===For small values===

Note that all dihedral groups are [[metacyclic group|metacyclic]] and hence supersolvable. A dihedral group is nilpotent if and only if it is of order <math>2^k</math> for some <math>k</math>. It is abelian only if it has order <math>2</math> or <math>4</math>.

==Subgroups==

{{further|[[Subgroup structure of dihedral groups]]}}

There are two kinds of subgroups:

* Subgroups of the form <math>\langle a^d \rangle</math>, where <math>d|n</math>. The number of such subgroups equals the [[number:divisor count function|number of positive divisors]] of <math>n</math>, sometimes denoted <math>\tau(n)</math>. The subgroup generated by <math>a^d</math> is a [[cyclic group]] of order <math>n/d</math>.
* Subgroups of the form <math>\langle a^d, a^r x \rangle</math>, where <math>d|n</math> and <math>0 \le r < d</math>. The number of such subgroups equals the [[number:divisor sum function|sum of all positive divisors]] of <math>n</math>, sometimes denoted <math>\sigma(n)</math>. The subgroup of the above form is a [[dihedral group]] of order <math>2n/d</math>.

In particular, all subgroups of the dihedral group are either cyclic or dihedral.

Also note that the dihedral group has subgroups of all orders dividing its order. This is true more generally for all [[finite supersolvable group]]s. {{further|[[Finite supersolvable implies subgroups of all orders dividing the group order]]}}

===Groups having the dihedral group as quotient===

The [[dicyclic group]], also called the binary dihedral group, of order <math>4n</math>, has the dihedral group of order <math>2n</math> as a quotient -- in fact the quotient by its [[center]], which is a cyclic subgroup of order two. the presentation for the dicyclic group is given by:

<math>\langle a,x \mid a^n = x^2 = (ax)^2 \rangle</math>.

Dicyclic groups whose order is a power of <math>2</math> are termed [[generalized quaternion group]]s.

==Definition==

This group, usually denoted <math>D_{12}</math> (though denoted <math>D_6</math> in an alternate convention) is defined in the following equivalent ways:

* It is the [[member of family::dihedral group]] of order twelve. In other words, it is the dihedral group of degree six, i.e., the group of symmetries of a regular hexagon.
* It is the [[direct product]] of [[symmetric group:S3|the symmetric group of degree three]] and [[cyclic group:Z2|the cyclic group of order two]].
* It is the [[outer linear group]] of degree two over the field of two elements, i.e., the group <math>OL(2,2)</math>. 
* It is [[Borel subgroup of general linear group]] for [[general linear group:GL(2,3)]], i.e., the [[general linear group of degree two]] over [[field:F3]].

The usual presentation is:

<math>\langle a,x \mid a^6 = x^2 = e, xax = a^{-1} \rangle</math>.

With this presentation, the symmetric group of degree three is the direct factor <math>\langle a^2,x \rangle</math> and the complement of order two is the subgroup <math>\langle a^3 \rangle</math>.

==Definition==

===Definition by presentation===

The '''dihedral group''' <math>\! D_{16}</math>, sometimes denoted <math>D_8</math>, also called the '''dihedral group of order sixteen''' or the '''dihedral group of degree eight''' or the '''dihedral group acting on eight elements''', is a [[dihedral group]] defined by the presentation:

<math>\langle a,x \mid a^8 = x^2 = e, xax^{-1} = a^{-1} \rangle</math>.

where <math>e</math> is the identity element.

The element <math>a</math> is termed a ''rotation'' or a ''generator of the cyclic piece'' and the element <math>x</math> is termed a ''reflection''.

Note that the notation <math>\! D_8</math> is more commonly used to denote the [[dihedral group:D8|dihedral group of order eight]].

===Geometric definition===

The '''dihedral group''' <math>D_{16}</math> (also called <math>D_8</math>) is defined as the group of all symmetries of the regular octagon. This has a cyclic subgroup comprising rotations (which is the cyclic subgroup generated by <math>a</math>) and has eight ''reflections'' each being an [[involution]]: four reflections about lines joining midpoints of opposite sides, and four reflections about diagonals.

===Definition as a permutation group===

The group can be defined as the subgroup of the symmetric group on <math>\{ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 \}</math> generated by a cycle of length <math>8</math> and a ''reflection'':

<math>\! \langle (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8), (1,8)(2,7)(3,6)(4,5) \rangle</math>
==Elements==

{{further|[[element structure of dihedral group:D16]]}}
===Upto conjugacy===

There are seven conjugacy classes of elements:

# The identity element. (1)
# The rotation by <math>\pi</math>, which is given by <math>a^4</math> in the presentation. (1)
# The rotations by <math>\pm \pi/2</math>, which are given by <math>a^{\pm 2}</math> in the presentation. (2)
# The rotations by <math>\pm \pi/4</math>, which are given by <math>a^{\pm 1}</math> in the presentation. (2)
# The rotations by <math>\pm 3\pi/4</math>, which are given by <math>a^{\pm 3}</math> in the presentation. (2)
# The rotations about axes joining opposite vertices, given by <math>x, a^2x, a^4x, a^6x</math> in the presentation. (4)
# The rotations about axes joining midpoints of opposite sides, given by <math>ax, a^3x, a^5x, a^7x</math> in the presentation. (4)

===Upto automorphism===

Under the action of outer automorphisms, the conjugacy classes (4) and (5) combine, and the conjugacy classes (6) and (7) combine. Thus, there are five equivalence classes of sizes <math>1,1,2,4,8</math>.

[[Importance rank::2| ]]
==Definition==

===Definition by presentation===

The '''dihedral group''' <math>D_8</math>, sometimes called <math>D_4</math>, also called the {{dihedral group}} of order eight or ''the dihedral group of degree four'' (since its natural action is on four elements), or sometimes the ''octic group'', is defined by the following [[presentation of a group|presentation]], with <math>e</math> denoting the identity element:

<math>\langle x,a \mid a^4 = x^2 = e, xax^{-1} = a^{-1}\rangle</math>

Here, the element <math>a</math> is termed the ''rotation'' or the ''generator of the cyclic piece'' and <math>x</math> is termed the ''reflection''.

{{quotation|Confused about presentations in general or this one in particular? If you're new to this stuff, check out [[constructing dihedral group:D8 from its presentation]]. Sophisticated group theorists need simply recall that [[presentation of semidirect product is disjoint union of presentations plus action by conjugation relations]]}}

===Geometric definition===

The '''dihedral group''' <math>D_8</math> (also called <math>D_4</math>) is defined as the group of all symmetries of the square (the regular 4-gon). This has a cyclic subgroup comprising rotations (which is the cyclic subgroup generated by <math>a</math>) and has four ''reflections'' each being an [[involution]]: reflections about lines joining midpoints of opposite sides, and reflections about diagonals.

===Definition as a permutation group===

{{further|[[D8 in S4]]}}

The group is (up to isomorphism) the subgroup of the symmetric group on <math>\{ 1,2,3,4 \}</math> given by:

<math>\! \{ (), (1,2,3,4), (1,3)(2,4), (1,4,3,2), (1,3), (2,4), (1,4)(2,3), (1,2)(3,4) \}</math>

This can be related to the geometric definition by thinking of <math>1,2,3,4</math> as the vertices of the square and considering an element of <math>D_8</math> in terms of its induced action on the vertices. It relates to the presentation via setting <math>a = (1,2,3,4)</math> and <math>x = (1,3)</math>.

===Multiplication table===

Here, <math>e</math> denotes the identity element, <math>a</math> is an element of order 4, and <math>x</math> is an element of order two that isn't equal to <math>a^2</math>, as in the above presentation. 

{{#lst:element structure of dihedral group:D8|multiplication table}}

===Other definitions===

The dihedral group can be described in the following ways:

# The [[dihedral group]] of order eight.
# The [[generalized dihedral group]] corresponding to [[cyclic group:Z4|the cyclic group of order four]].
# The [[holomorph of a group|holomorph]] of the [[cyclic group:Z4|cyclic group of order four]].
# The [[external wreath product]] of the cyclic group of order two with the cyclic group of order two, acting via the regular action.
# The <math>2</math>-[[Sylow subgroup]] of the [[symmetric group:S4|symmetric group on four letters]].
# The <math>2</math>-[[Sylow subgroup]] of the [[symmetric group:S5|symmetric group on five letters]].
# The <math>2</math>-[[Sylow subgroup]] of the [[alternating group:A6|alternating group on six letters]].
# The [[member of family::unitriangular matrix group of degree three]] <math>UT(3,2)</math> over [[field:F2]], <math>2</math>-[[Sylow subgroup]] of [[projective special linear group:PSL(3,2)|PSL(3,2)]].
# The [[member of family::extraspecial group]] of order <math>2^3</math> and type '+'.

==Distinguishing features==

===Smallest of its kind===

* This is the unique non-[[T-group]] of smallest order, i.e., the unique smallest example of a group in which [[normality is not transitive]].
* This is a non-abelian nilpotent group of smallest order, though not the only one. The other such group is the [[quaternion group]].

===Different from others of the same order===

* It is the only group of its order that is isomorphic to its [[automorphism group]].
* It is the only group of its order that is not a [[T-group]].
* It is the only group of its order having two Klein four-subgroups. In particular, it gives an example of a situation where the number of elementary abelian subgroups of order <math>p^2</math> is neither zero nor <math>1</math> modulo <math>p</math>. Contrast this with the case of odd <math>p</math>, where we have the [[congruence condition on number of elementary abelian subgroups of prime-square order for odd prime]].

===Description by presentation===

Here is the code:

<pre>gap> F := FreeGroup(2);;
gap> G := F/[F.1^4, F.2^2, F.2 * F.1 * F.2 * F.1];
<fp group on the generators [ f1, f2 ]>
gap> IdGroup(G);
[ 8, 3 ]</pre>

The group <math>G</math> constructed here is the dihedral group of order <math>8</math>. The first generator <math>F.1</math> maps to the ''rotation'' element of order four and the second generator <math>F.2</math> maps to a ''reflection'' element of order two.

===Long descriptions===

It can be described as the [[holomorph of a group|holomorph]] of the cyclic group of order four. For this, first define <math>C</math> to be the cyclic group of order four (using [[GAP:CyclicGroup|CyclicGroup]]), and then use [[GAP:SemidirectProduct|SemidirectProduct]] and [[GAP:AutomorphismGroup|AutomorphismGroup]]:

<pre>C := CyclicGroup(4);
G := SemidirectProduct(AutomorphismGroup(C),C);</pre>

Here, <math>G</math> is the dihedral group of order eight. We can also construct it as a semidirect product of the Klein four-group and an automorphism of order two.

<pre>K := DirectProduct(CyclicGroup(2),CyclicGroup(2));
A := AutomorphismGroup(K);
S := SylowSubgroup(A,2);
G := SemidirectProduct(S,K);</pre>

Then, <math>G</math> is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order eight.

===GAP verification===

Note that we also allow infinitely many subgroups, in which case, the internal direct product would correspond to the [[restricted external direct product]]. || there is a collection of subgroups <math>H_i, i \in I</math> with <math>H</math> equal to one of the <math>H_i</math>s, such that <math>G</math> is the internal direct product of the <math>H_i</math>s.
|}

===Equivalence of definitions===

The equivalence of definitions follows largely from the [[equivalence of internal and external direct product]].
{{semibasicdef}}
{{pivotal subgroup property}}
{{variation of|normal subgroup}}
{{subgroup property conjunction|normal subgroup|retract}}
==Examples==

{{subgroup property see examples}}

===Extreme examples===

Every group is the internal direct product of itself and the trivial subgroup. Thus:

# The trivial subgroup is a direct factor of the whole group.
# Every group is a direct factor of itself.

===High occurrence examples===

# In a [[finite nilpotent group]], all the [[Sylow subgroup]]s are direct factors. In particular, a finite nilpotent group is the direct product of its Sylow subgroups. {{further|[[equivalence of definitions of finite nilpotent group]]}}
# In a vector space, any vector subspace is a direct factor, because the complementary subspace can be taken as the complement for an internal direct product.

===Relationship with external direct product and restricted external direct product===

# If a group <math>G</math> arises as the [[external direct product]] of finitely or infinitely many groups <math>G_i, i \in I</math>, then for any subset <math>J \subseteq I</math>, the subset of <math>G</math> arising as those elements where all coordinates outside of <math>J</math> are trivial is a direct factor of <math>G</math>. The complementary factor can be taken as the subgroup of <math>G</math> where all coordinates in <math>J</math> are trivial.
# A similar observation holds for the [[restricted external direct product]].

==GAP implementation==

{{GAP ID|32|46}}

===Other descriptions===

The group can be constructed using GAP's [[GAP:DirectProduct|DirectProduct]], [[GAP:DihedralGroup|DihedralGroup]], and [[GAP:ElementaryAbelianGroup]] functions:

<tt>DirectProduct(DihedralGroup(8),ElementaryAbelianGroup(4))</tt>

https://groupprops.subwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Direct_product_of_D8_and_V4&action=edit

{{particular group}}
[[importance rank::3| ]]
==Definition==

This group is defined in the following ways:

* It is the [[external direct product]] of [[dihedral group:D8|the dihedral group of order eight]] and [[cyclic group:Z2|the cyclic group of order two]].
* It is the [[member of family::generalized dihedral group]] corresponding to the [[direct product of Z4 and Z2]].
* It is the <math>2</math>-[[Sylow subgroup]] of the [[symmetric group:S6|symmetric group of degree six]].

A presentation for it is:

<math>G := \langle a,x,y \mid a^4 = x^2 = y^2 = e, xax = a^{-1}, ya = ay, xy = yx \rangle</math>.

==Elements==

===Upto conjugacy===

There are ten conjugacy classes:

# The identity element. (1)
# The element <math>a^2</math>. (1)
# The element <math>y</math>. (1)
# The element <math>a^2y </math>. (1)
# The two-element conjugacy class comprising <math>a</math> and <math>a^3</math>. (2)
# The two-element conjugacy class comprising <math>ay</math> and <math>a^3y</math>. (2)
# The two-element conjugacy class comprising <math>x</math> and <math>a^2x</math>. (2)
# The two-element conjugacy class comprising <math>xy</math> and <math>a^2xy</math>. (2)
# The two-element conjugacy class comprising <math>ax</math> and <math>a^3x</math>. (2)
# The two-element conjugacy class comprising <math>axy</math> and <math>a^3xy</math>. (2)

===Upto automorphism===

Under the action of the automorphism group, the conjugacy classes (3) and (4) are in the same orbit -- in other words, <math>y</math> and <math>a^2y</math> are related by an automorphism. The conjugacy classes (5) and (6) are equivalent, and the conjugacy classes (7)-(10) are equivalent. Thus, the equivalence classes have sizes <math>1,1,2,4,8</math>.

[[importance rank::3| ]]
==Definition==

This group is defined in a number of equivalent ways:

# It is the '''full octahedral group''': the group of all rigid symmetries (both orientation-preserving and orientation-reversing) of the regular octahedron.
# It is the '''full cube group''': the group of all rigid symmetries (both orientation-preserving and orientation-reversing) of the cube.
# It is the [[external direct product]] of the [[defining ingredient::symmetric group:S4|symmetric group of degree four]] and the [[defining ingredient::cyclic group:Z2|cyclic group of order two]].
# It is the [[automorphism group]] of the [[general linear group:GL(2,3)]], i.e., the [[general linear group of degree two]] over the field of three elements.
# It is the [[wreath product]] of the [[cyclic group:Z2|cyclic group of order two]] and the [[symmetric group:S3|symmetric group of degree three]]. In other words, it is the group <math>(\Z_2 \times \Z_2 \times \Z_2) \rtimes S_3</math> where <math>S_3</math> acts by coordinate permutations.
# It is the [[signed symmetric group]] of degree three. (Note: This is a reinterpretation of the previous definition as a wreath product).
# It is the [[projective general linear group of degree two]] over the ring <math>\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}</math>, i.e., it is the group <math>PGL(2,\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z})</math>. Note that this is ''not'' the same as the group <math>PGL(2,4)</math>, which is the projective general linear group of degree two over [[field:F4]] (and which is isomorphic to [[alternating group:A5]], a group of order 60).

===As a direct product===

The '''direct product of Z4 and Z2''' is an [[abelian group]] of order eight obtained as the [[external direct product]] of [[defining ingredient::cyclic group:Z4]] and [[defining ingredient::cyclic group:Z2]].

===As a presentation===

If we denote by <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> the generators of the direct factors, then the presentation is given by:

<math>G := \langle a,b \mid a^4 = b^2 = e, ab = ba \rangle</math>.

Writing the presentation in additive notation, with commutativity implicit:

<math>G := \langle a,b \mid 4a = 2b = 0 \rangle</math>.

===Multiplication table===

Here, we use ordered pairs, as is typical for external direct products, with the first coordinate corresponding to the cyclic group of order four and the second coordinate corresponding to the cyclic group of order two. From the presentation notation, <math>a = (1,0), b = (0,1)</math> and <math>ma + nb = (m,n)</math>.

==Subgroups==

{{further|[[Subgroup structure of direct product of Z4 and Z2]]}}

The group has the following eight subgroups (all of which are [[normal subgroup]]s, since the group is abelian):

# The trivial subgroup. Isomorphic to [[subgroup::trivial group]]. (1)
# The cyclic subgroup of order two comprising the squares, i.e., the [[agemo subgroups of a group of prime power order|first agemo subgroup]]. In our notation, this is the subgroup <math>\{ (2,0), (0,0 \}</math>. Isomorphic to [[subgroup::cyclic group:Z2]]. (1)
# Two other cyclic subgroups of order two, generated by elements that are not squares. In our notation, these are <math>\{ (0,1), (0,0) \}</math> and <math>\{ (2,1), (0,0) \}</math>. These are related by an outer automorphism. Isomorphic to [[cyclic group:Z2]]. (2)
# The group of order four comprising all the elements of order dividing two. In other words, the [[omega subgroups of a group of prime power order|first omega subgroup]]. In our notation, this is <math>\{ (2,0), (0,1), (2,1), (0,0) \}</math>. Isomorphic to [[subgroup::Klein four-group]]. (1)
# The two cyclic subgroups of order four, generated by elements of order four. In our notation. these are <math>\{ (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (0,0) \}</math> and <math>(1,1), (2,0), (3,1), (0,0) \}</math>. These are related by an outer automorphism. Isomorphic to [[subgroup::cyclic group:Z4]]. (2)
# The whole group. (1)

===[[Normal subgroup]]s===

Since the group is abelian, all subgroups are normal.

===[[Characteristic subgroup]]s===

The subgroups of type (1), (2), (4) and (6) are characteristic. In particular, there is exactly one characteristic subgroup of each [[order of a group|order]].

{{particular group}}

==Definition==

This group can be defined in the following equivalent ways:

# It is the [[external direct product]] of the [[group of rational numbers]] <math>\mathbb{Q}</math> and the [[group of rational numbers modulo integers]] <math>\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}</math>. Explicitly, it is the group <math>\mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}</math>.
# It is the [[external central product]] of two copies of the [[group of rational numbers]] where we identify a copy of the [[group of integers in group of rational numbers]] in both groups with each other. Explicitly, it is the central product of <math>\mathbb{Q} *_\mathbb{Z} \mathbb{Z}</math>.
