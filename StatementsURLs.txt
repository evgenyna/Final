Suppose P is a group of prime power order .
A subgroup A of P is termed a CENTRALIZER-LARGE SUBGROUP if | A | | C _ ( P ) ( A ) | ‚â• | B | | C _ ( P ) ( B ) | for all subgroups P of B.

Suppose A = ‚Ñö ‚ü® x ‚ÇÅ , x ‚ÇÇ , ‚Ä¶ , x _ ( n ) ‚ü© is a free associative ‚Ñö-algebra on finitely many variables x ‚ÇÅ , x ‚ÇÇ , ‚Ä¶ , x _ ( n ) .
Note that this is like a polynomial ring , except that the variables do not commute .
Let ‚ÑöL be the ‚Ñö-Lie subalgebra of A generated by x ‚ÇÅ , x ‚ÇÇ , ‚Ä¶ , x _ ( n ) .
It is true that L is the free Lie algebra on x ‚ÇÅ , x ‚ÇÇ , ‚Ä¶ , x _ ( n ) .
Let k be a positive integer .
The claim is that the homogeneous degree k component of ‚ÑöL is equal to the eigenspace of the Dynkin operator with eigenvalue k .
In other words , an element a ‚àà A is in this degree k component if and only if Œ¥ ( a ) = ka , where Œ¥ denotes the Dynkin operator .
Note that the statement holds independent of whether we choose the left-normed or right-normed Dynkin operator .
In particular , since ‚ÑöL is itself the direct sum of its homogeneous degree components , we obtain that ‚ÑöL is the direct sum of its eigenspaces for all positive integers .
Note that the Dynkin operator can be thought of as multiplication by the following element of ‚Ñö [ S _ ( k ) ] ( where we denote the identity element by 1 : ( 1 ‚àí ( 1 , 2 , 3 , ‚Ä¶ , k ) ) ‚Ä¶ ( 1 ‚àí ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) ) ( 1 ‚àí ( 1 , 2 ) ) With this interpretation , the result says that for a given k , the Schur functor describing the degree k Lie operad is the left ideal generated by the Dynkin element .
Further , this tells us that the image of the degree k component of the associative algebra under the Dynkin element gives us the degree k component of ‚ÑöL .

Suppose P is a group of prime power order .
Let ùíú ( P ) denote the set of abelian subgroups of maximum order in P .
If A ‚àà ùíú ( P ) , and V is an A-invariant abelian subgroup of P. Then , [ V , A ] C _ ( A ) ( [ V , A ] ) is an abelian subgroup of maximum order .
