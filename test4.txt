Suppose A = ℚ ⟨ x ₁ , x ₂ , … , x _ ( n ) ⟩ is a free associative ℚ-algebra on finitely many variables x ₁ , x ₂ , … , x _ ( n ) .
Note that this is like a polynomial ring , except that the variables do not commute .
Let ℚL be the ℚ-Lie subalgebra of A generated by x ₁ , x ₂ , … , x _ ( n ) .
It is true that L is the free Lie algebra on x ₁ , x ₂ , … , x _ ( n ) .
Let k be a positive integer .
The claim is that the homogeneous degree k component of ℚL is equal to the eigenspace of the Dynkin operator with eigenvalue k .
In other words , an element a ∈ A is in this degree k component if and only if δ ( a ) = ka , where δ denotes the Dynkin operator .
Note that the statement holds independent of whether we choose the left-normed or right-normed Dynkin operator .
In particular , since ℚL is itself the direct sum of its homogeneous degree components , we obtain that ℚL is the direct sum of its eigenspaces for all positive integers .
Note that the Dynkin operator can be thought of as multiplication by the following element of ℚ [ S _ ( k ) ] ( where we denote the identity element by 1 : ( 1 − ( 1 , 2 , 3 , … , k ) ) … ( 1 − ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) ) ( 1 − ( 1 , 2 ) ) With this interpretation , the result says that for a given k , the Schur functor describing the degree k Lie operad is the left ideal generated by the Dynkin element .
Further , this tells us that the image of the degree k component of the associative algebra under the Dynkin element gives us the degree k component of ℚL .
