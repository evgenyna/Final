The "Token0"-triangle group or "Token3"-triangle group is defined as the triangle group with parameters "Token0".
Equivalently, it is defined as:"Token1".Here, "Token2" is the identity element.
The term "Token0"-triangle group or "Token3"-triangle group is also used for the subgroup of index two in this group, which we refer to (7,3,2)-von Dyck group.

The "Token0"-von Dyck group, also sometimes termed the "Token3"-von Dyck group, is defined as the von Dyck group with parameters "Token0".
In other words, it has the presentation:"Token1"where "Token2" denotes the identity element.
This group is also sometimes termed the "Token0"-triangle group, though that name is also used for the (7,3,2)-triangle group, in which this is a subgroup of index two.

A subgroup "Token3" of a group "Token0" is termed a "Token6"-'''automorphism-invariant''' subgroup if any defining ingredient::1-automorphism of a group|1-automorphism of "Token0" sends "Token3" to itself.
In other words, for every 1-automorphism "Token2" of "Token0", "Token1".{{frexp}}The property of being a 1-automorphism-invariant subgroup can be expressed as an {{invariance property}}:1-automorphism "
Token4
" FunctionIn other words, "Token3" is a 1-automorphism-invariant subgroup of a group "Token0" if and only if every 1-automorphism of "Token0" restricts to a function from "Token3" to itself.
Alternative function restriction expressions are:* 1-automorphism "Token4"
1-endomorphism
* 1-automorphism "Token4"
1-automorphism.
This shows that the property of being a 1-automorphism-invariant subgroup is a {{balanced subgroup property}} with respect to 1-automorphisms.
*
In any group, the whole group and the trivial subgroup are 1-automorphism-invariant.
*
In a cyclic group, every subgroup is 1-automorphism-invariant.
*
If the set of elements of order "Token5
" form a subgroup for any particular "Token5
", then that subgroup is 1-automorphism-invariant.
This is because 1-automorphisms preserve the orders of elements.

Suppose "Token0" and "Token1" are groups.
We say that "Token0" and "Token1" are '''1-isomorphic''' if there exists a 1-isomorphism of groups|1-isomorphism between "Token0" and "Token1", i.e., a 1-homomorphism of groups from "Token0" to "Token1" whose inverse is also a 1-homomorphism.
In other words, there is a bijection between "Token0" and "Token1" whose restriction to any cyclic subgroup on either side is an isomorphism to its image.
G. A. Miller used the term ''conformal groups'' to describe what are referred to here are 1-isomorphic groups.
However, the term "conformal group" has a different, much more famous meaning as the group of angle-preserving symmetries of a geometric space.
Two finite groups that are 1-isomorphic are termed 1-isomorphic finite groups.
There are many equivalent characterizations of 1-isomorphic finite groups.
Any Lazard Lie group is 1-isomorphic to the additive group of its Lazard Lie ring.
This shows that many group of prime power order|groups of small prime power order are 1-isomorphic to abelian group of prime power order|abelian groups.

A subring of a Lie ring is termed a '''2-sub-ideal''' if it is an ideal of a Lie ring|ideal of an ideal of the Lie ring.{{further|2-sub-ideal of a Lie algebra}}A 2-sub-ideal of a Lie algebra is a 2-sub-ideal of a Lie ring that is also a linear subspace.
Note that there is a somewhat subtle but important point here.
For the definition of 2-sub-ideal, we need it to be an ideal of an ideal of the whole ring.
It turns out that, if the bottom subset is a linear subspace of the Lie algebra, we can choose the intermediate ideal to also be a linear subspace, and hence to be an ideal in the Lie algebra sense.
Suppose "Token0" is a Lazard Lie group and "Token1" is its Lazard Lie ring.
Under the natural bijection between "Token1" and "Token0", the 2-sub-ideals of "Token1" correspond to the 2-subnormal subgroups of "Token0".

A '''3-transposition group''' is defined as a group that is either trivial group|trivial or has a generating set that is a ''single'' conjugacy class whose elements are defining ingredient::3-transpositions, i.e., involutions such that the product of any of them with any conjugate has order 1, 2, or 3.3-transposition groups were studied by Fischer.
In addition to various infinite families, he identified a small number of them, called Fischer groups, that did not fall into the infinite families.
This gave rise to three new sporadic simple groups.

This is because the Sylow subgroups of the direct product are the direct products of the individual Sylow subgroups.{{S-closed}}Any subgroup of an A-group is an A-group.
This follows from the fact that a "Token2"-Sylow subgroup of a subgroup is a "Token2"-group in the whole group, and hence is contained in a "Token2"-Sylow subgroup of the whole group, which is Abelian.
Hence, the "Token2"-Sylow subgroup of the subgroup is also Abelian.{{Q-closed}}Any quotient of an A-group is an A-group.
This follows from the fact that under a quotient mapping, the image of a Sylow subgroup remains a Sylow subgroup.

An APS of groups is an APS over the category of groups.
More specifically, an APS "Token13" of groups is the following data:
* For each natural number "Token19", a group, denoted "Token14".
* For each ordered pair "Token10" of natural numbers, a homomorphism "Token11".Satisfying  the following compatibility conditions:For "Token1" in "Token2" respectively:"Token17".The above condition is termed an associativity condition.
We may assume "Token20" as the trivial group and define "Token18" and "Token15" as trivial paddings.
For an APS "Token13" the member "Token14" is termed the "Token3" member of the APS.
A '''member''' of the APS is an object that is the "Token3" member for some "Token19".An '''element''' of the APS is an element of some member of the APS.The '''home''' of an element of the APS is the member in which it lies.
The '''index''' of a member is the "Token19" for which it is the "Token3" member.
The maps "Token5" are termed '''block concatenation maps'''.The ground member of an APS is its first member.{{further|APS homomorphism}}Given APSes "Token13" and "Token16", a homomorphism "Token8" &rarr; "Token9

" associates, to each "Token19", a subgroup "Token12" of "Token14", such that the image of "Token4" under "Token5

APS}}A quotient APS is the image of an APS in a homomorphism that is surjective at each member.
Given a homomorphism of APSes of groups, the kernels of the individual homomorphisms for a sub-APS of the domain APS, and the images of the individual homomorphism form a sub-APS of the range APS.The image is thus a quotient
APS.Further, we have the following result: a sub-APS of an APS of groups occurs as the kernel of an APS homomorphism if and only if every member of it is a normal subgroup of the corresponding member of the whole APS.
A sub-APS satisfying either of these equivalent conditions is termed a normal sub-APS.This parallels the group theory result that a subgroup of a group occurs as the kernel of a group homomorphism if and only if it is normal.
An APS of groups is termed injective, or an IAPS of groups, if every block concatenation map is injective.
For an IAPS of groups, we usually also assume the condition of refinability.
Very few APSes of groups are commutative.
Note that a commutative APS cannot also be injective.
Most APSes of groups that we encounter satisfy the condition of being padding-injective.

An '''abelian group''' is a group where any two elements commute.
In symbols, a group "Token7" is termed '''abelian''' if for any elements "Token37" and "Token21" in "Token7", "Token10" (here "Token34" denotes the product of "Token37" and "Token21" in "Token7").
Note that "Token13" are allowed to be equal, though equal elements commute anyway, so we can restrict attention if we wish to unequal elements.<center>{{widget:YouTube|id=uMVm9oSoa6A}}</center><section end=beginner/>An '''abelian group''' is a set "Token7" equipped with a (infix) binary operation "Token0" (called the addition or group operation), an identity element "Token23" and a (prefix) unary operation "Token32", called the inverse map or negation map, satisfying the following:
* For any "Token27", "Token19".
This property is termed associativity.
* For any "Token31", "Token41". "Token23" thus plays the role of an additive identity element or neutral element.
*
For any "Token31", "Token4".
Thus, "Token11" is an inverse element to "Token38" with respect to "Token0".
*
For any "Token9", "Token30".
This property is termed commutativity.
A group "Token7" is termed abelian if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:
* Its defining ingredient::center "Token29" is the whole group.
* Its defining ingredient::derived subgroup "Token6" is trivial.
*
(Choose a generating set "Token25" for "Token7").
For any elements "Token20", "Token16".
*
The diagonal subgroup "Token35" is a defining ingredient::normal subgroup inside "Token22".<section begin=beginner/>When "Token7
" is an abelian group, we typically use ''additive'' notation and terminology.
Thus, the group multiplication is termed ''addition'' and the product of two elements is termed the ''sum''.
The infix operator "Token0" is used for the group multiplication, so the sum of two elements "Token38" and "Token26" is denoted by "Token5".
The group multiplication is termed ''addition'' and the product of two elements is termed the ''sum''.
The identity element is typically denoted as "Token23" and termed ''zero''
The inverse of an element is termed its ''negative'' or ''additive inverse''.
The inverse of "Token38" is denoted "Token11" "Token33" done "Token39" times is denoted "Token24", (where "Token3") while "Token2" done "Token39" times is denoted "Token15".This convention is typically followed in a situation where we are dealing with the abelian group "Token7" in isolation, rather than as a subgroup of a possibly non-abelian group.
If we are working with subgroups in a non-abelian group, we typically use multiplicative notation even if the subgroup happens to be abelian.{{group property see examples}}The additive group of integers "Token12", the additive group of rational numbers "Token1", the additive group of real numbers "Token36", the multiplicative group of nonzero rationals "Token28", and the multiplicative group of nonzero real numbers "Token40" are some examples of Abelian groups.(More generally, for any field, the additive group, and the multiplicative group of nonzero elements, are Abelian groups).<section end=beginner/><section begin=revisit/>Cyclic groups are good examples of abelian groups, where the cyclic group of order "Token39" is the group of integers modulo "Token39".
Further, any direct product of cyclic groups is also an abelian group.
Further, every finitely generated group|finitely generated Abelian group is obtained this way.
This is the famous structure theorem for finitely generated abelian groups.
The structure theorem can be used to generate a complete listing of finite abelian groups, as described here: classification of finite Abelian groups.
Not every group is abelian.
The smallest non-abelian group is symmetric group:S3|the symmetric group on three letters: the group of all permutations on three letters, under composition.
Its being non-abelian hinges on the fact that the order in which permutations are performed matters.<section end=revisit/>Every cyclic group is abelian.
Since each group is generated by its cyclic subgroups, every group is generated by a family of abelian subgroups.
A trickier question is: do there exist abelian normal subgroups?
A good candidate for an abelian normal subgroup is the center, which is the collection of elements of the group that commute with ''every'' element of the group.
The maximal abelian quotient of any group is termed its abelianization, and this is the quotient by the derived subgroup.
A subgroup is an abelian-quotient subgroup (i.e., normal with abelian quotient group) if and only if the subgroup contains the derived subgroup.{| class="sortable" border="1"!

Quotient group acts on abelian normal subgroup:
One of the main differences between Abelian normal subgroups and other normal subgroups is that for an Abelian normal subgroup, there is a well-defined action of the quotient group on the subgroup.
This is the beginning of group cohomology, which essentially looks at the study of groups that have a given Abelian normal subgroup and a given quotient group, with a specified action of the quotient group on the subgroup.
* Degree of irreducible representation divides index of abelian normal subgroup:
For a finite group, the degrees of irreducible representations over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero divide the index of any Abelian normal subgroup.
* Maximal among abelian normal implies self-centralizing in nilpotent and maximal among abelian normal implies self-centralizing in supersolvable: In a group that is nilpotent or supersolvable, any subgroup that is maximal among Abelian normal subgroups contains its own centralizer.{{intransitive}}An abelian normal subgroup of an abelian normal subgroup need not be an abelian normal subgroup.{{intsubcondn}}If "Token2" is an abelian normal subgroup of "Token0", "Token2" is also an abelian normal subgroup in any intermediate subgroup "Token1".
This follows from the fact that ''normality'' satisfies the same condition: Normality satisfies intermediate subgroup condition.{{imagecondn}}The image of an sbelian normal subgroup under a surjective homomorphism is an Abelian normal subgroup of the image.
This follows from two facts: Abelianness is quotient-closed, and normality satisfies image condition.{{intersection-closed}}An intersection of a nonempty collection of Abelian normal subgroups is again an Abelian normal subgroup.
This follows from two facts: Abelianness is subgroup-closed, and normality is strongly intersection-closed.{{not join-closed}}A join of Abelian normal subgroups of a group need not be an Abelian normal subgroup.
A join of finitely many Abelian normal subgroups, however, is guaranteed to be nilpotent.

Let "Token0" be a group of prime power order, i.e., a finite "Token1"-group for some prime "Token1".
A subgroup "Token2" of "Token0" is termed an '''abelian subgroup of maximum order'''
(sometimes also a '''large abelian subgroup''')
if "Token2" is an abelian subgroup, and the order of any abelian subgroup of "Token0" divides the order of "Token2".The set of abelian subgroups of maximum order in a group "Token0" of prime power order is sometimes denoted "Token3".
Their join, termed the join of abelian subgroups of maximum order, and is sometimes also termed the Thompson subgroup.
This set of subgroups satisfies some powerful replacement theorems, most notably Thompson's replacement theorem.

Let "Token4" be an associative algebra over a field "Token10" with the property that for any "Token11", there exists "Token3" such that "Token13".
(in other words, "Token4" is a radical ring).Then, the '''algebra group''' corresponding to "Token4" is the adjoint group of "Token4", i.e., the group whose elements are formally:"Token6"where the multiplication is defined as:"Token1"There are two interpretations of this: We can think of the algebra group as living inside the unitization "
Token8" as the coset of "Token4" for "Token0".
Alternatively, since there is a bijection between "Token4" and its algebra group, we can think of the algebra group as simply the set "Token4" with group operation "Token14".
This is based on the idea of the multiplicative formal group law.
However, unlike other formal group laws, the multiplicative formal group law is valid even in ''non-commutative'' settings, and that is necessary for this definition.
If "Token4" is an associative algebra over a field "Token10" with the property that every element of "Token4" is nilpotent, then it is true that for any "Token11", there exists "Token3" such that "Token13".
Thus, we can always define the algebra group corresponding to any such algebra "Token4".If "Token10" is a finite field and "Token4" is a finite-dimensional associative algebra over "Token10", the following are equivalent: For any "Token11", there exists "Token3" such that "Token13".
Every element of "Token4" is nilpotent. "
Token4" is a nilpotent algebra, i.e., there is some fixed length such that all products of that length of elements in "Token4" equal zero.
Thus, for a finite-dimensional associative algebra over a finite field "Token10", we talk of its algebra group only if it satisfies these equivalent conditions.
A group of prime power order which can be realized as an algebra group any finite field is termed an '''algebra group'''.
Note that an algebra group over "Token9
", where "Token5
" is a power of a prime "Token7", must also be an algebra group over the prime field "Token2".
Thus, saying that a finite "Token7"-group is an algebra group is equivalent to saying that it is an algebra group over "Token2".Note that the nilpotent associative algebra up to isomorphism determines the algebra group up to isomorphism.
However, it is not ''a priori'' clear whether the group up to isomorphism determines the nilpotent associative algebra up to isomorphism.
It turns out that it does not, but there are important restrictions on the structure of the algebra that can be deduced from the group structure.
* Non-isomorphic nilpotent associative algebras may have isomorphic algebra groups* Powering map by field characteristic is same in algebra and algebra group
* Lazard Lie ring of adjoint group of a radical ring equals associated Lie ring of the radical ring under suitable nilpotency assumptionsGiven a finite p-group, it is not necessarily an algebra group over "Token2".
Below are some things we can deduce if it is an algebra group:
* Algebra group is isomorphic to algebra subgroup of unitriangular matrix group of degree one more than logarithm of order to base of field size:
Note that this gives a complete characterization of algebra groups, at least in the finite case.
What it says is that any algebra group over "Token9
" of order "Token12" is isomorphic to an algebra subgroup of the unitriangular matrix group "Token15".

A group is said to be '''ambivalent''' if every element in it is defining ingredient::conjugate elements|conjugate to its inverse.
For a finite group,this is equivalent to saying that every character of the group over complex numbers, is real-valued.
An element in a group that is conjugate to its inverse is termed a defining ingredient::real element.
Thus, a group is ambivalent if and only if all its elements are real elements.
A group "Token0" is said to be '''ambivalent''' if, for any "Token11", there exists "Token5" such that "Token12".For a finite group "Token0", this is equivalent to saying that any representation "Token3" with character "Token1", "Token13" for all "Token11".

A discrete group "Token0" is termed an '''amenable discrete group''' if there exists a function that assigns to each subset of "Token0" a real number in "Token3" such that:
* The number associated with the whole of "Token0" is "Token4"
* The function is finitely additive on subsets.
In other words, the number associated with a disjoint union of finitely many subsets is the sum of the numbers associated with each of the subsets*
The function is left-invariant, viz., the value associated with a subset "Token2" is the same as the value associated with "Token1"Often, when dealing with an abstract group, we use the term '''amenable group''' for amenable discrete group (in other words, we assume that the discrete topology is put over the group).

Let "Token0" be a group and "Token4" be an element.
Then, the '''approximate normalizer''' of "Token6", denoted as "Token2" is defined as the set of all elements "Token1" for which there exist nonzero integers "Token3

It equals the whole group if the element has finite order (viz, is a torsion element).

Let "Token0" be a group and consider:"Token2"a subnormal series for "Token0".
The '''associated direct sum''' for this series is the abstract group:"Token1"(direct sum here means the same thing as direct product).

Every automorphism of a subgroup series|automorphism of the subnormal series defines an automorphism of the associated direct sum.
Thus, there is a homomorphism from the automorphism group of the subnormal series, to the automorphism group of the associated direct sum.
The kernel of this homomorphism is termed the stability group of a subnormal series|stability group.
* If the subnormal series is a normal series, then every inner automorphism becomes an automorphism of the subgroup series, and hence gives rise to an automorphism of the direct sum.
* If the subnormal series is a central series, then every inner automorphism is a stability automorphism of the subgroup series, and hence gives rise to the identity map on the direct sum.
* If the subnormal series is a characteristic series, then every automorphism of the group is an automorphism of the subgroup series, hence we have a map from the automorphism group of the whole group to the automorphism group of the associated direct sum.
When the subgroup series is a strongly central series, the associated direct sum acquires the structure of a Lie ring.{{further|associated Lie ring for a strongly central series}}

The '''automorphism group''' of a group is defined as a group whose elements are all the automorphism of a group|automorphisms of the base group, and where the group operation is composition of automorphisms.
In other words, it gets a group structure as a subgroup of the group of all permutations of the group.
The '''automorphism group''' of a group "Token4", denoted "Token16", is a set whose elements are automorphisms "Token0", and where the group multiplication is composition of automorphisms.
In other words, its group structure is obtained as a subgroup of "Token15", the group of all permutations on "Token4".Every group-closed automorphism property gives rise to a normal subgroup of the automorphism group.

An '''automorphism''' of a group is any of the following equivalent things:
* An isomorphism of groups|isomorphism from the group to itself*
A bijective endomorphism of a group|endomorphism of the group*
A homomorphism of groups|homomorphism that is both an endomorphism and an isomorphismLet "Token0" be a group.
A map "Token3" from "Token0" to itself is termed an '''automorphism''' of "Token0" if it satisfies all of the following conditions:
* "Token3" is bijective*
"Token4"
whenever "Token6"
and "Token2" are both in "Token0
"* "Token1"*
"Token5"Actually, the third and fourth condition follow from the first two (refer equivalence of definitions of group homomorphism).These are properties of (function from a group to itself) that are stronger than the property of being an automorphism:
* Inner automorphism:
An automorphism that arises as conjugation via an element of the group* Power automorphism:
An automorphism that maps each element to a power of itselfThese are properties of (function from a group to itself) that that are weaker than the property of being an automorphism, viz function properties that are satisfied by every automorphism:*
Injective endomorphism* Surjective endomorphism* Endomorphism* Semiautomorphism* QuasiautomorphismThe composite of two automorphisms of a group is again an automorphism of the group.
This follows from the fact that the composite of any two isomorphisms is an isomorphism.
The inverse of any automorphism is an automorphism.
The identity map is always an automorphism.
Combining the fact that automorphisms are closed under composition, inverse and contain the identity map, the automorphisms of a group form a subgroup of the monoid of all fucntions from the group to itself.
This subgroup is termed the automorphism group of the given group.{{further|inner automorphism}}There is a natural homomorphism of groups|homomorphism from any group to its automorphism group, that sends each element of the group to the conjugation map by that element.
The image of the group under this map is termed the inner automorphism group, and automorphisms arising as such images are termed inner automorphisms.{{further|characteristic
subgroup}}A subgroup of a group is said to be characteristic subgroup|characteristic if every automorphism of the group maps it to itself.
Characteristic subgroups are thus the '''automorphism-invariant subgroups''' (the invariance property for automorphisms)and the property of being characteristic is stronger than the property of being normal subgroup|normal, which is just invariance under inner automorphisms.
Characteristic subgroups also arise naturally as images of subgroup-defining functions.
Two subgroups of a group are said to be automorphs if there is an automorphism of the whole group that maps one subgroup to the other.
Clearly, for a characteristic subgroup, it has no automorph other than itself.
Subgroups which are automorphs are equivalent in all respects.
Conjugate subgroups are automatically automorphs, because every inner automorphism is also an automorphism.

Note that "Token13" depends on "Token8".
There is a normal subset "Token2" of "Token0" that is a generating set of "Token0" and such that, for all "Token5", "Token1" is in the conjugacy class of "Token8", i.e., there exists "Token10" such that "Token9".

A group is termed a '''BFC-group''' if there is a finite constant "Token5" such that no element in the group has more than "Token5

Any Abelian group is a 1-BFC-group.
* Finite group* Abelian group* FZ-group* FC-group{{S-closed}}Any subgroup of a BFC-group is a BFC-group.
In fact, any subgroup of a "Token5"-BFC group is a "Token5"-BFC group.
This follows from the fact that if two elements in the subgroup are conjugate in the subgroup, they are conjugate in the whole group.
Hence, any conjugacy class in the subgroup is contained in  a conjugacy class in the whole group.{{DP-closed}}A direct product of BFC-groups is a BFC-group.
In fact, a direct product of a "Token4"-BFC-group and a "Token3"-BFC-group is a "Token2"-BFC-group.
This follows from the fact that if two elements in the direct product of "Token6" and "Token1" are conjugate, then their "Token6"-coordinates are conjugate and their "Token1"-coordinates are conjugate.
Hence, conjugacy classes in "Token0" are simply the pairwise direct products of conjugacy classes in "Token6" and "Token1".

A subgroup property is said to be a '''balanced subgroup property''' if it can be expressed via a function restriction expression with both the ''left side'' and the ''right side'' being equal.
A subgroup property is said to be a '''balanced subgroup property''' if it can be expressed as "Token1" where "Token4" is a function property.
In other words, a subgroup "Token3" satisfies the property in a group "Token0"
if and only if every function on "Token0" satisfying property "Token4" in "Token0" restricts to a function satisfying property "
Token4" on "Token3".The property of a subgroup being characteristic subgroup|characteristic is expressible as a balanaced subgroup property in the function restriction formalism as follows:Automorphism
"Token2" Automorphism* Fully characteristic subgroup = Endomorphism "Token2" endomorphism* Injective endomorphism-invariant subgroup = Injective endomorphism "Token2" injective endomorphism* Retraction-invariant subgroup = Retraction "Token2" Retraction*
Transitively normal subgroup =
Normal automorphism "Token2" Normal automorphism
* Conjugacy-closed normal subgroup =
Class automorphism "Token2" Class automorphism* Central factor =
Inner automorphism "Token2
" inner automorphismClearly, any balanced subgroup property with respect to the function restriction formalism is both transitive subgroup property|transitive and identity-true subgroup property|identity-true.
Hence, it is a t.i. subgroup property.
Interestingly, a partial converse holds by the balance theorem: every t.i.
subgroup property that can be expressed using the function restriction formalism, is actually a balanced subgroup property.
In fact, more strongly, a balanced expression for the property can be obtained by using either the right tightening operator or the left tightening operator to any starting expression.
In general, a balanced subgroup property need not be intersection-closed.
In general, a balanced subgroup property need not be join-closed.

A ''quantified word-letter pair'' is a word with a distinguished letter, with a sequence of (possibly nested) existential and universal quantifiers on all the other letters.
An element "Token1" in a group "Token0" satisfies this pair if setting the distinguished letter equal to "Token1", the nested expression is true in the group (where existential and universal quantifiers are interpreted over "Token0").
The subgroup corresponding to a quantified word-letter pair is defined as the subgroup generated by all elements of the group satisfying that pair.

CEP-subgroups are also termed '''normal-sensitive subgroups'''.A subgroup "Token4" of a group "Token0" is termed a '''CEP subgroup''' if for any normal subgroup "Token3" of "Token4", there is a normal subgroup "Token2" of "Token0" such that "Token1" &cap; "Token4".In terms of the subgroup intersection extension formalism, the property of being a CEP subgroup is the balanced property with respect to the subgroup property of normality.
Every subgroup of a group is a CEP-subgroup if and only if the group is a solvable group|solvable T-group.

This follows from the fact that the property of being CEP is a ''balanced'' subgroup property with respect to a suitable formalism.{{trim}}The improper subgroup, or the whole group, is clearly a CEP subgroup, so the property of being a CEP subgroup is identity-true subgroup property|identity-true.
The trivial subgroup is also a CEP subgroup, so the property of being a CEP subgroup is trivially  true.

A '''CS-Baer Lie group''' is a group "Token0" satisfying '''both''' the following two conditions: "Token0" is a defining ingredient::group of nilpotency class two, i.e., its nilpotency class is at most two.
Equivalently, the derived subgroup "Token4" is contained in the center "Token1" of "Token0".
There exists a subgroup "Token3" of "Token0" such that "Token5", and every element of "Token4" has a unique square root within "Token3".For finite groups, being a CS-Baer Lie group is equivalent to being a LCS-Baer Lie group, which in turn means that it is a group of class two whose 2-Sylow subgroup is abelian.
There are examples of infinite groups that are CS-Baer but not LCS-Baer.
The smallest example is central product of UT(3,Z) and Z identifying center with 2Z.
Note that this particular example is a LUCS-Baer Lie group (see LUCS-Baer Lie groupExamples).We can create examples of CS-Baer Lie groups that are neither LUCS-Baer Lie groups nor LCS-Baer Lie groups, by combining features of the above examples.
Specifically, let "Token0" be the group central product of UT(3,Z) and Z identifying center with 2Z.
Then, the group "Token2" is a CS-Baer Lie group but it fails to be a LUCS-Baer Lie group (since it has 2-torsion within the center).
It also fails to be a LCS-Baer Lie group (since the derived subgroup itself does not allow for halving).{| class="sortable" border="1"!

A group "Token0" is said to be '''capable''' if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions: It is isomorphic to the defining ingredient::inner automorphism group of some group.

An element of a group is termed central if the following equivalent conditions hold: It commutes with every element of the group Its centralizer is the whole group It is the only element in its conjugacy class.
In other words, under the group acts as automorphisms by conjugation|action of the group on itself by conjugation, it is a fixed point.
Under the group acts as automorphisms by conjugation|action of the group on itself by conjugation, it fixes everything.
In other words, it is in the kernel of the action of the group on itself by conjugation.
The '''center''' of a group is the set of its central elements.
The center is clearly a subgroup.
Alternatively, the center of a group is defined as the kernel of the homomorphism from the group to its automorphism group, that sends each element to the corresponding inner automorphism.
(see group acts as automorphisms by conjugation).Given a group "Token5", the '''center''' of "Token5", denoted "Token18", is defined as the set of elements "Token4
" that satisfy the following equivalent conditions: "Token6" for all "Token20" in "Token5" "Token10" The conjugacy class of "Token4" in "Token5
" is the singleton "Token16".
In other words, under the action of "Token5" on itself by conjugation, the orbit of "Token4" is a one-point set -- "Token4" is a fixed point.
For the action of "Token5" on itself by conjugation, "Token4" acts trivially on everything.
In other words, conjugation by "Token4" fixes every element.
Alternatively, "Token18" is defined as the kernel of the map "Token1" given by "Token19", where "Token8" is conjugation by "Token4".
(see group acts as automorphisms by conjugation).The center of any group must be an abelian group.
Conversely every abelian group occurs as the center of some group (in fact, of itself).{| class="sortable" border="1"!

Description|-| associated quotient-defining function || inner automorphism group
||
The quotient of a group by its center is isomorphic to the group of inner automorphisms, i.e. the subgroup of the automorphism group comprising those automorphisms that can be expressed using conjugation maps.
This is because the map from a group to its automorphism group that sends "Token4" to "Token15" is a homomorphism, and its kernel is precisely the center "Token18".|-| associated ascending series || upper central series || Start with a group "Token5".
The upper central series of "Token5" is defined as follows.
Consider "Token7".
Let "Token2", in general, be the inverse image in "Token5
" of "Token14" under the canonical projection "Token9".
Essentially we are iterating the quotient-defining function that sends a group to the inner automorphism group, and taking the kernel at each step.
However, we are pulling back that kernel all the way to "Token5".
<br>
By convention (and commonsense) "Token17" is the trivial group.<br
>
A group for which the upper central series terminates in finite length at the whole group is termed a nilpotent group.|}Below are some examples where the center is a proper and nontrivial subgroup.
In other words, these examples exclude abelian groups (where the center is the whole group) and centerless groups (where the center is trivial):The '''quotient part''' in the table below refers to the quotient by the center, which is isomorphic to the inner automorphism

A subgroup of a group is termed a '''central factor of normalizer''' if it satisfies the following equivalent conditinos:
* It is a central factor of its normalizer*
Every inner automorphism of the group that restricts to an automorphism on the subgroup restricts to an inner automorphism on the subgroup.
A subgroup "Token8" of a group "Token0" is termed a '''central factor of normalizer''' if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:* "Token5" where "Token4" denotes the centralizer of "Token8" in "Token0".
* For any "Token12" in "Token0" such that "Token6", there exists an element "Token1" in "Token8" such that for any "Token9" in "Token0", "Token11".{{first-order subgroup
property}}A subgroup "
Token8" of a group "Token0" is a WC-subgroup if it satisfies the following condition:"Token2"{{obtainedbyapplyingthe|in-normalizer operator|central factor}}A subgroup is a WC-subgroup if and only if it is a central factor of its normalizer.
This can be expressed in terms of thein-normalizer operator.
The in-normalizer operator takes a subgroup property "Token7" and outputs the property of being a subgroup that satisfies property "Token7
" inside the normalizer.
The property of being a WC subgroup is the balanced property with respect to the when-defined function restriction formalism.
Note that balanced properties for ''when-defined'' formalisms are not necessarily transitive.
*
Central factor: Its normalizer is the whole group, and it is clearly a central factor in that
* Self-normalizing subgroup: Its normalizer is itself, and it is clearly a central factor of itself.
*
Cocentral subgroup*
Sub-WC-subgroup{{intransitive}}Check out the Property operators|property operators part of this page for more details.
It seems unlikely that an intersection of WC-subgroups should again be a WC-subgroup.{{intsubcondn}}If "Token10" and "Token0" be a WC-subgroup of "Token3".
Then, any inner automorphism of "Token8" arises from an inner automorphism of "Token3", hence the restriction of an inner automorphism of "Token8" to "Token0" is also the restriction of an inner automorphism of "Token3" to "Token0".
Hence, it must be an inner automorphism of "Token0".Any WC-subgroup of a central factor is a WC-subgroup.
Thus, the right transiter of the property of being a WC-subgroup is weaker than the property of being a central factor.
It's not clear whether it is exactly equal.
The property of being a WC subgroup is not transitive.
Thus, there is a notion of sub-WC-subgroup.

A group is said to be '''centralizer-connected''' if the centralizer of any element is either the whole group or has infinite index in the group.
, or equivalently, if every conjugacy class with more than one element has infinite size.
The concept of '''centralizer-connected''' is closely related to the concept of connected.
In particular, for a connected topological group, every conjugacy class is connected (as it arises as the image of the group under a continuous map).
Hence, it must either be a single point or infinite in size, so it must be centralizer-connecteed.
These are stronger properties that are satisfied by groups with some additional structure:* Connected topological group* Connected algebraic group* Connected group for logicistsIn a centralizer-connected group, any finite normal subgroup is central.

* Malnormal subgroup* Frobenius kernel* Self-centralizing subgroup{{transitive}}If "Token3" is a CC-subgroup of "Token2" and "Token2" is a CC-subgroup of "Token0", then "Token3" is a CC-subgroup of "Token0".
The proof of this follows directly from the definitions.{{trim}}The trivial subgroup is clearly CC, and so is the whole group.

A nontrivial group is said to be '''centrally indecomposable''' if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions: It cannot be expressed as the defining ingredient::central product of two proper subgroups.
Every proper nontrivial defining ingredient::central factor is a defining ingredient::central subgroup, i.e., it is contained in the center of the group.
A group "Token0" is said to be a centrally indecomposable group if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions: We cannot write "Token2", viz., as a central product for proper subgroups "
Token4" and "Token3" of "Token0".
Every proper nontrivial central factor of "Token0" is a central subgroup of "Token0", i.e., it is contained in the center "Token1".

* Fully invariant closure*
Normal closure*
Characteristic core* Normal coreThe fact that characteristicity is the left transiter for normality has an interesting implication on the relation between characteristic closure and normal closure.
Namely, given a subgroup "Token4" of "Token0", the characteristic closure of "Token4" in "Token0" is the smallest subgroup "Token3
" containing "Token4" such that whenever "Token5", "Token6".In other words, the normal closure of a subgroup may not remain a normal closure if we expand the bigger group.
However,the characteristic closure remains normal even in an expanded bigger group (as long we we expand
normally).We can prove that for any minimal normal subgroup, the characteristic closure is a direct product of its automorphs.
The idea of the proof is induction -- we build a collection of automorphs of the minimal normal subgroup.
At each stage, we check if the automorphs generate the characteristic closure.
If they do, then we have shown that the characteristic closure is a direct product of automorphs.
Otherwise, there is some automorph not in the direct product of automorphs so far.
Since this automorph is again a minimal normal subgroup, it must intersect the direct product so far, trivially.
Thus, we have got a bigger direct product.

However, it can be reduced to the problem of finding a small generating set for the automorphism group of the bigger group.{{GAP command for subgroup property|test = IsCharacteristicSubgroup|list = CharacteristicSubgroups}}The GAP syntax for testing whether a subgroup is characteristic in a group is:<tt>IsCharacteristicSubgroup (group, subgroup);</tt>where <tt>subgroup</tt> and <tt>group</tt> may be defined on the spot in terms of generators or may refer to things defined previously.
The list of all characteristic subgroups can be obtained by:<tt>
CharacteristicSubgroups(group);</tt>{{msc class|20A05}}Broadly speaking, "characteristic subgroups" are not a separate area of study in group theory, but rather, characteristic subgroups are an important part of the vocabulary that comes up in any sufficiently "pure" study of group theory.
Characteristic subgroups are relatively less important in the study of group actions, and more important in the study of abstract group structure.{{term introduced by|Ferdinand
Georg Frobenius}}The notion of '''characteristic subgroup''' was introduced by Frobenius in 1895.
His motivation was to capture the property of being a subgroup that is ''invariant'' under all symmetries of the group, and is hence ''intrinsic'' to the group.
Frobenius wanted to use the term ''invariant subgroup'' but at the time, the term ''invariant subgroup'' was used for normal subgroup.
Any typical question about the behavior of characteristic subgroups in arbitrary groups that is easy to formulate will also be easy to resolve either with a proof or a counterexample, unless some ''other'' feature of the question significantly complicates it.
This is so, despite the fact that there are a large number of easy-to-formulate questions about the automorphism group that are still open.
The reason is that even though not enough is known about the automorphism groups, there are other ways to obtain information about the structure of characteristic subgroups.
At the one extreme, there are abelian groups, where the characteristic subgroups are quite easy to get a handle on.
At the other extreme, there are "all groups" where very little can be said about characteristic subgroups beyond what can be proved through elementary reasoning.
The most interesting situation is in the middle, for instance, when we are looking at nilpotent groups and solvable groups.
In these cases, there are some restrictions on the structure of characteristic subgroups, but the exact nature of the restrictions is hard to work out.
Below are listed some of the more cutting-edge questions that are relatively easy to formulate and are partially open.{| class="sortable" border="1"!
Problem description !!
More details|-| potentially characteristic subgroups characterization problem
||
This problem (or rather, constellation of problems) asks, given a subgroup "Token29", whether there exists a group "Token47" containing "Token8" such that "Token20" is characteristic in "Token47".
Questions of this type are generally much harder to resolve than formulate.|-| Characteristic not implies powering-invariant in nilpotent group ||
This disproves the conjecture that if "Token20" is a characteristic subgroup of a nilpotent group "Token8", then "Token20" is a powering-invariant subgroup of "Token8", i.e., if "Token8" is powered group for a set of primes|powered over a prime "Token35" (unique "Token35"-divisibility),
so is "Token20".|-| Bryant-Kovacs theorem
||
This theorem provides a "rigidification" result that guarantees the existence of finite p-groups with specific patterns of characteristic subgroups containing the Frattini subgroup.|}* {{paperlink-defined|Frobenius95}}, Page 183* {{booklink-defined|BurnsideFiniteGroups|92||}}: The terminology and language in this book is antiquated, and is only of historical interest.

This group is denoted "Token7" and is defined in a number of equivalent ways.
The circle group is defined as the group, under multiplication, of complex numbers of modulus one.
In other words, it is the group of complex numbers on the unit circle, under multiplication.
An equivalent description of the circle group is as the quotient group "Token3", where "Token0" is the additive group of real numbers and "Token1" is the subgroup of "Token0" defined as the additive group of integers.
Note that the isomorphism between the group "Token3" and the complex numbers of modulus one is given by:"Token8".The circle group can also be defined in the following equivalent ways:
* It is the group of rotations in the plane (including the identity map) that fix a particular point, under composition.
* It is the special orthogonal group of degree two over the real numbers.
In other words, it is the group "Token2".Note that the term '''circle group''' may be used for the more general notion of the circle group over any field or ring.
The circle group over a field "Token5
" is the group "Token6".{| class="sortable" border="1"!

An automorphism of a group is termed a '''class-inverting automorphism''' if it sends every element to an element that is in the conjugacy class of its inverse.
An automorphism "Token1" of a group "Token0" is termed a '''class-inverting automorphism''' if, for any "Token4", there exists "Token2" such that
"Token3".Note that the set of class-inverting automorphisms, if non-empty, is a group only if the group is an ambivalent group, i.e., every element is conjugate to its inverse.
In this case, it is the group of class-preserving automorphisms.
Otherwise, it is a single coset of the group of class-preserving automorphisms, and the class-preserving and class-inverting automorphisms together form a normal subgroup of the automorphism group.

A field is termed '''class-separating''' for a group if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions: Given any two conjugacy classes in the group, there exists a finite-dimensional linear representation of the group over the field such that the images of the conjugacy classes, are not conjugate in the  general linear group.
Given two elements of the group whose images are conjugate in the general linear group for every finite-dimensional linear representations, the two elements must be conjugate in the group.
No two distinct conjugacy classes can be locally conjugate conjugacy classes|locally conjugate.

" is a finite-dimensional  "Token12"-vector space, such that "Token18" and "Token19" are not in the same conjugacy class in "Token3".
Given two elements "Token17" and "Token4" in "Token0" such that "Token13" and "Token9
" are conjugate in "Token3" for every finite-dimensional linear representation "Token15" of "Token0", we can conclude that "Token17" and "Token4" are conjugate elements inside "Token0".{{further|conjugacy class-representation duality}}Let "Token2" denote the conjugacy class in "Token3" of the image of the conjugacy class "Token16" of "Token0" under the representation "Token15".

A subgroup of a group is termed a '''cofactorial automorphism-invariant subgroup''' if it is invariant under all the defining ingredient::cofactorial automorphisms of the whole group.
Suppose "Token0" is a finite group.
A subgroup "Token8" of "Token0" is termed a '''cofactorial automorphism-invariant subgroup''' if "Token8" is invariant under every automorphism "Token4" of "Token0" for which all prime factors of the order of "Token4" are prime factors of the order of "Token0".Suppose "Token0" is a periodic group: every element of "Token0" has finite order.
A subgroup "Token8" of "Token0" is termed '''cofactorial automorphism-invariant''' if "Token8" is invariant under every automorphism "Token4" of "Token0" such that "Token4" has finite order, and every prime divisor of the order of "Token4" occurs as the prime divisor of the order of some element of "Token0".If the group has any element of infinite order, we define '''cofactorial automorphism-invariant''' to be the same as defining ingredient::characteristic subgroup.
If "Token0" is a p-group for some prime "Token5
" (in the finite case, this means "Token0" is a group of prime power order, in the infinite case it simply means that every element has order a power of "Token5"), a cofactorial automorphism-invariant subgroup is the same as a p-automorphism-invariant subgroup.{{frexp}}

The property of being a cofactorial automorphism-invariant subgroup can be expressed as an {{invariance property}}:Cofactorial automorphism "Token9

Given two subgroup properties "Token3" and "Token2", the composition operator applied to these properties, denoted as "Token1", is the property defined as follows: "Token6" has the property "Token1" as a subgroup of "Token0" if there is an intermediate subgroup "Token4
" such that "Token6" satisfies "Token3" as a subgroup of "Token4" and "Token4" satisfies "Token2" as a subgroup of "Token0".Given subgroup properties "Token3", "Token2", and "Token5", the following relation holds:"Token7"In other words, the composition operator is associativity|associative.
The composition operator is a monotone operator in both arguments, when the properties are given the usual partial order of implication.
Further, it distributes over logical disjunction, and is hence a quantalic property operator.
The identity element for the composition operator is the property of being the improper subgroup, that is, of being the group embedded as a subgroup in itself.
Any property that is implied by this property is termed an identity-true subgroup property.
The nil element for the composition operator is the fallacy subgroup property, that is the subgroup property that is ''never'' satisfied.
Since the composition operator is an associative quantalic property operator, the Transiter master theorem is applicable to it, and we can talk of left transiters, right transiters.
We can also talk of the subordination with respect to this operator.

A subgroup "Token2" of a group "Token0" is termed '''compressed''' if for any subgroup "Token1" of "Token0" containing "Token2", the rank of a group|rank of "Token2" is not more than the rank of "Token1".We typically study compressed subgroups inside a free group.
The subgroup property of being compressed is obtained by applying the intermediately operator to the subgroup property of being a rank-dominated subgroup.
A subgroup is said to be rank-dominated in a group if the rank of the subgroup is not more than the rank of the group.
* Inert subgroup* Finite-index-maximal subgroup in case we are working within a free groupIt is not clear whether any compressed subgroup of a compressed subgroup is compressed.
The problem lies with the fact that intermediate subgroups containing the smaller subgroup may not be comparable either way with the bigger subgroup.{{intsubcondn}}If a subgroup is compressed in terms of the whole group, it is clearly compressed in every intermediate subgroup.{{trim}}Clearly, the trivial subgroup is compressed in any group, because it is generated by zero elements.

A '''congruence on a group''' is an equivalence relation on the elements of the group that is compatible with all the group operations.
A congruence on a group "Token0" is an equivalence relation "Token1" on "Token0"
such that:
* "Token2"
* "Token3"The term '''congruence''' can more generally be used for any algebra, in the theory of universal algebras.
{{further|congruence on an algebra}}It is easy to see that the congruence class of the identity element is a normal subgroup.
Conversely, given any normal subgroup, there is a unique congruence where the congruence class of the identity element is that normal subgroup.
The congruence classes here are the cosets of the normal subgroup.
Given a congruence on a group, there is a natural quotient map from the group to the set of congruence classes.
Under this map, the set of congruence classes inherits a group structure.
This is termed the quotient group.

A '''conjugacy class''' in a group can be defined in any of the following ways:
* It is an Defining ingredient::orbit of the group (as a set) under the group acts as automorphisms by conjugation|action of the group on itself by conjugation (or as Defining ingredient::inner automorphisms)
* It is an equivalence class under the equivalence relation of being Defining ingredient::conjugate elements|conjugateSuppose "Token0" is a group.
A '''conjugacy class''' in "Token0" is a nonempty subset of a group|subset "Token9
" of "Token0" such that the following two conditions hold:* Given any "Token7", there exists "Token8" such that "Token4".
*
If "Token1" and "Token8
" then "Token10".In other words, it is closed under the group acts as automorphisms by conjugation|action of the group on itself by conjugation, and the action is transitive when restricted to the conjugacy class.
In the language of group actions, it is a single orbit under the action of the group on itself by conjugation.
Any group is a disjoint union of conjugacy classes.{{quotation|''If you're interested in conjugacy classes in a particular group, go to the article on that group, and look at the subsection titled '''Under conjugation''' in the section titled '''Elements'''.''}}
*
In an Abelian group, all the conjugacy classes are singleton sets of size 1.
That's because for any "Token3", we have "Token2
"* More generally, for any group "Token0", and any element in the center of "Token0", the conjugacy class of that element has size 1.

The symmetric group:S3|symmetric group on three letters is the smallest non-Abelian group.
This group has three conjugacy classes, the class of the identity element (size 1), the class of the transpositions (size 3) and the class of the 3-cycles (size 2).
* More generally, in the symmetric group on any set, two permutations are in the same conjugacy class if and only if they have the same cycle type. {{further|Cycle type determines conjugacy class}}
*
The size of any conjugacy class divides the order of the group, for a finite group.
More precisely, it is the index of the centralizer of any element of the conjugacy class.
This follows from the more general fact that the size of any orbit under a group action is the index of the stabilizer of any point in the orbit.
{{further|size of conjugacy class divides order of group, size of conjugacy class divides index of center}}

A conjugacy class has size 1 iff the corresponding element is in the center.

The sizes of the conjugacy classes are related by a class equation*
The set of conjugacy classes can be given an algebraic structure in various ways; for instance, the convolution algebra on conjugacy classes*

For the action of the whole group on the coset space, every element of the group has a fixed point.
A subgroup "Token12" of a group "Token0" is termed '''conjugate-dense''' in "Token0" if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:* "Token16"
* For any "Token8", there exists "Token15" such that "Token1"
* For every cyclic subgroup "Token6", there exists "Token15" such that
"Token14"
* Under the natural action of "Token0" on the coset space "Token13", every "Token5" has a fixed point.
*
Contranormal subgroup: Here, we only require that the normal closure should be the whole group.
Note that the normal closure may, in general be much bigger than the union of conjugates.
* Finite-dominating subgroup* Subgroup of finite index: It turns out that there cannot be a conjugate-dense subgroup of finite index other than the whole group. {{proofat|Union of all conjugates is proper}}
* Normal subgroup: Clearly, the only normal conjugate-dense subgroup is the whole groupThe general context in which being conjugate-dense is important is as follows.
Suppose "Token4" is a set with some additional structure, and "Token0" is the group of automorphisms with that additional structure.
This "Token0" could in principle be very huge, and unmanageable.
Now suppose adding some ''further'' structure to "Token4" causes the automorphism group to reduce to a much smaller subgroup "Token12" of "Token0".In principle we could lose a lot of the symmetry in "Token0" when we pass to "Token12".
Thus, we are often interested in the question: when can we guarantee that every "Token5" is conjugate (in "Token0") to some element of "Token12"?
In other words, is "Token12" conjugate-dense in "Token0"?
If the answer to this question is ''yes'', then that means that at least if we are looking at only one element of "Token0" at a time, then we might safely assume that our element is in "Token12".Examples of passage to additional structure are:* Giving a differential structure to a topological manifold* Giving a Riemannian structure to a topological or differential manifold (typically, the isometry group of a Riemannian manifold is far from conjugate-dense in the group of diffeomorphisms or homeomorphisms)
* Giving a linear or piecewise linear structure (or a simplicial structure) to a topological manifoldThe importance of finite-dominating subgroups is for similar reasons.
For a full list of examples, refer::Category:Instances of conjugate-dense subgroups*
The subgroup of upper triangular matrices, viz the Borel subgroup "Token9
", is conjugate-dense in "Token2": in other words, every invertible matrix is conjugate to an upper triangular matrix (the analogous result does not hold for a non-algebraically closed field, and in particular, it doesn't hold for any finite field).
{{further|Triangulability theorem}}
*
The statement that every element of "Token10" is a rotation about some axis (called Euler's theorem) can be rephrased as saying that "Token11" is conjugate-dense in "Token10" {{further|Euler's theorem}}{{transitive}}If "Token3" are subgroups such that "Token7" is the union of conjugates of "Token12" within "Token7", and "Token0" is the union of conjugates of "Token7" within "Token0", then:Every conjugate of "Token7" within "Token0" is expressible as a union of conjugates of "Token12" within "Token0".This forces "Token12" to be conjugate-dense in "Token0".
{{proofat|Conjugate-denseness is transitive}}The property of being conjugate-dense can be satisfied by the trivial subgroup only if the whole group is trivial.
However, it is always satisfied by the whole group, hence it is {{i-true}}.The property of being conjugate-dense probably does not satisfy the intermediate subgroup condition.

The action of the group on the coset space is effective (that is, every element of the group acts nontrivially on the coset space)A subgroup "Token3
" of a group "Token0" is termed ''core-free'' if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:* "Token5" is the trivial subgroup.
*
The action of "Token0" by left multiplication on the coset space "Token6" is effective, that is, for every "Token7", there is a coset "Token8" such that "Token4".{{first-order subgroup property}}A subgroup "Token3" is core-free in a group "Token0" if:"Token1"Essentially, we are using the fact that the normal core can be described using a first-order condition.
*
Proper malnormal subgroup* Proper TI-subgroupGiven a subgroup "Token3" of "Token0"
, "Token0" acts transitively on the coset space of "
Token3".Conversely any transitive group action can be modelled as an action on the coset space of a subgroup.
Thus, we have the following:"Token0" has a core-free subgroup of index "Token2" if and only if it can be embedded as a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group on "Token2" elements.
Core-freeness is a lower hereditary property, that is, any subgroup of a core-free subgroup is again core-free.
Moreover, the trivial subgroup is always core-free.
From lower hereditariness, it follows that core-freeness is transitive and that an intersection of core-free subgroups is core-free.
Core-freeness is also upper hereditary: any core-free subgroup of a subgroup is core-free in the whole group.
If a group has a maximal subgroup that is also core-free, then it is termed a primitive group.
This is equivalent to the other definition: the group is primitive if it has an effective primitive group action.

In fact, it is the only nontrivial group with the property of having no nontrivial automorphisms.
{{further|trivial automorphism group implies trivial or order two}}The cyclic group of order two admits two endomorphisms:
the identity map and the trivial map (the map sending both elements to the identity element).There are only two subgroups: the trivial subgroup and the whole group.
Most of the ''nice'' subgroup properties are true for both.
There are only two quotients: itself and the trivial quotient.{{further|supergroups of cyclic group:Z2}}The cyclic group of order 2 occurs as a subgroup in many groups.
In general, any group of even order contains a cyclic subgroup of order 2 (this follows from Cauchy's theorem, which is a corollary of Sylow's theorem, though it can also be proved by a direct counting argument).
Elements of order 2, which are generators for cyclic groups of order 2, are termed involutions.
The cyclic group of order 2 may occur as a normal subgroup in some groups.
Examples are the general linear group or special linear group over a field whose characteristic is not 2.
This is the group comprising the identity and negative identity matrix.
It is also true that a normal subgroup of order two is central subgroup|central.
More generally, it is true that normal of least prime order implies central|a normal subgroup whose order is the least prime divisor of the order of the group is central.
Thus, the existence of normal subgroups of order two indicates a nontrivial center.
Viewed another way, given a group "Token3
", it often happens that we can find a group "Token6" with a surjective homomorphism to "Token3" whose kernel is a cyclic group of order 2.
In some cases, the Schur multiplier of the group is the cyclic group of order "Token17".
An example is the projective special linear group, whose Schur multiplier has order two and the universal central extension is the special linear group.
The cyclic group of order 2 occurs very often as a quotient.
Put another way, given a group, we can often find a subgroup of index two.
Any subgroup of index two is normal (more generally, any subgroup of least prime index is normal).In these cases, the group of order two may or may not occur as a complement to the normal subgroup.
Examples where it ''does'' occur as a complement are the alternating group in the symmetric group, or "Token1" in "Token20".Viewed another way, given a group "Token3
", we may often be able to construct a group "Token6" in which "Token3" has index two.
The cyclic group of order two lies in the family of cyclic groups, of general linear groups, and of symmetric groups.
It also lies in the family of sphere groups: namely, it is the group of unit vectors in "Token11".
The other two sphere groups are "Token19" (the circle group) and "Token15" (the unit quaternion group).{{GAP ID|2|1}}{| class="sortable" border="1"!

|| Equivalence of definitions of group of prime order|Simple abelian if and only if prime order |||}Any endomorphism of a cyclic group is determined by where it sends the generator.
The cyclic group of order three has three endomorphisms:
* The identity map is an endomorphism.
This map sends every element to itself.
*
The square map is an endomorphism.
This map sends "Token5" to "Token0", "Token0" to "Token5", and "Token2" to itself.
*
The trivial map is an endomorphism.
This map sends every element to "Token2".Of the three endomorphisms, two are automorphisms: the identity map and the square map.
These form a cyclic group of order two: the square map, applied twice, gives the identity map.
The group has no proper nontrivial subgroups: the only subgroups are the whole group and the trivial subgroup.
More generally, any nontrivial group with no proper nontrivial subgroup must be cyclic of prime order.
Conversely, any cyclic group of prime order has no proper nontrivial subgroup.
{{further|No proper nontrivial subgroup implies cyclic of prime order}}The cyclic group of order three has only two quotients: the whole group and the trivial quotient.
This follows from the fact that this group is simple -- it has no proper nontrivial normal subgroup.{{holomorph|symmetric group:S3}}The holomorph of this group, i.e., the semidirect product of this group with its automorphism group, is isomorphic to the symmetric group on three letters.
The cyclic group sits inside this as the alternating group and the automorphism group sits inside as a subgroup of order two.
The cyclic group of order 3 occurs as a subgroup in many groups.
In general, a group contains a cyclic subgroup of order three if and only if its order is a multiple of three (this follows from Cauchy's theorem, a corollary of Sylow's
theorem).The cyclic group of order three occurs as a normal subgroup in some groups.
For instance, if a field contains non-identity cuberoots of unity, then the multiplicative group of the field contains a cyclic subgroup of order three.
As a corollary, the general linear group contains a central subgroup of order three.
Normal subgroups of order three need not be central; for instance, in the symmetric group:S3|symmetric group on three letters, the alternating group is a normal subgroup of order three, but is not central.
However, for an odd-order group, any normal subgroup of order three is central.
This follows from a more general fact: normal of least prime order implies central|a normal subgroup whose order is the least prime divisor of the order of the group is central.{{GAP ID|3|1}}The cyclic group of order three can be defined using the GAP:

It is the normal closure of the subgroup generated by all elements of the form "Token4".
it is the intersection of all abelian-quotient subgroups of "Token0", viz.
, subgroups "Token1" such that "Token7" is an abelian group.{{proofat|Equivalence of definitions of derived subgroup}}It is ''not'' true that every group can be realized as the derived subgroup of another group -- for instance, the characteristically metacyclic and commutator-realizable implies abelian tells us that a group whose first two abelianizations are cyclic, but whose second derived subgroup is not trivial, cannot arise as a derived subgroup.{{associated qdf|Abelianization}}The quotient of a group by its commutator subgroup is termed its Abelianization.
This can also be thought of as the ''largest'' possible Abelian quotient of the group.{{associated ds|Derived series}}The series obtained by iterating the commutator subgroup-defining function is termed the derived series.
The "Token3" member of this is termed the "Token3" derived subgroup.
A group for which this derived series terminates at the identity in finitely many steps is termed a solvable group and the length of the derived series is termed the derived length.

Suppose "Token0" is a group and "Token4" is an unrestricted external direct product of "Token1" copies of "Token0".
Equivalently, "Token2" can be thought of as the group of functions from "Token3" to "Token0" with the group operations performed pointwise.
Then, the diagonal subgroup is the subgroup comprising the constant functions from "Token3" to "Token0", or equivalently, the elements of "Token2" with all coordinates equal.

The '''dihedral group''' of degree "Token19" and order "Token16", denoted sometimes as sometimes as "Token39" ('''this wiki uses "Token39"'''), sometimes as "Token2", and sometimes as "Token28", is defined in the following equivalent ways:
* It has the presentation (here, "Token4" denotes the identity element):"Token9"
* (For "Token24"): It is the group of symmetries of a regular "Token19"-gon in the plane, viz., the plane isometries that preserves the set of points of the regular "Token19"-gon.
The dihedral groups arise as a special case of a family of groups called von Dyck groups.
They also arise as a special case of a family of groups called Coxeter groups.
Note that for "Token13" and "Token8", the geometric description of the dihedral group does not make sense.
In these cases, we use the algebraic description.
The infinite dihedral group, which is the "Token0" case of the dihedral group and is denoted "Token15" and is defined as:"Token38".
* Generalized dihedral group: This is a semidirect product of an abelian group by a cyclic group of order two acting via the inverse map.
* q-hedral group* Coxeter group: Dihedral groups are Coxeter groups with two generators.
Note that all dihedral groups are metacyclic group|metacyclic and hence supersolvable.

The '''dihedral group''' "Token32", sometimes denoted "Token13", also called the '''dihedral group of order sixteen''' or the '''dihedral group of degree eight''' or the '''dihedral group acting on eight elements''', is a dihedral group defined by the presentation:"Token16".where "Token3" is the identity element.
The element "Token28" is termed a ''rotation'' or a ''generator of the cyclic piece'' and the element "Token27" is termed a ''reflection''.Note that the notation "Token14" is more commonly used to denote the dihedral group:D8|dihedral group of order eight.
The '''dihedral group''' "Token2" (also called "Token13") is defined as the group of all symmetries of the regular octagon.
This has a cyclic subgroup comprising rotations (which is the cyclic subgroup generated by "Token28") and has eight ''reflections'' each being an involution: four reflections about lines joining midpoints of opposite sides, and four reflections about diagonals.
The group can be defined as the subgroup of the symmetric group on "Token30" generated by a cycle of length "Token0" and a ''reflection'':"Token29"{{further|element structure of dihedral group:D16}}There are seven conjugacy classes of elements: The identity element.
(1) The rotation by "Token5", which is given by "Token10" in the presentation.
(1) The rotations by "Token7", which are given by "Token8" in the presentation.
(2)
The rotations by "Token22", which are given by "Token4" in the presentation.
(2) The rotations by "Token9", which are given by "Token24" in the presentation.
(2)
The rotations about axes joining opposite vertices, given by "Token31" in the presentation.
(4)
The rotations about axes joining midpoints of opposite sides, given by "Token33" in the presentation.
(4)Under the action of outer automorphisms, the conjugacy classes (4) and (5) combine, and the conjugacy classes (6) and (7) combine.
Thus, there are five equivalence classes of sizes "Token20".{{dihedral 2-group arithmetic function table|order

The '''dihedral group''' "Token19", sometimes called "Token23", also called the {{dihedral group}} of order eight or ''the dihedral group of degree four'' (since its natural action is on four elements), or sometimes the ''octic group'', is defined by the following presentation of a group|presentation, with "Token5
" denoting the identity element:"Token0"Here, the element "Token27" is termed the ''rotation'' or the ''generator of the cyclic piece'' and "Token41" is termed the ''reflection''.{{quotation|Confused about presentations in general or this one in particular?

This has a cyclic subgroup comprising rotations (which is the cyclic subgroup generated by "Token27") and has four ''reflections'' each being an involution: reflections about lines joining midpoints of opposite sides, and reflections about diagonals.{{further|D8 in S4}}The group is (up to isomorphism) the subgroup of the symmetric group on "Token36" given by:"Token4"This can be related to the geometric definition by thinking of "Token28" as the vertices of the square and considering an element of "Token19" in terms of its induced action on the vertices.
It relates to the presentation via setting "Token11" and "Token10".Here, "Token5
" denotes the identity element, "Token27" is an element of order 4, and "Token41" is an element of order two that isn't equal to "Token34", as in the above presentation.

* This is the unique non-T-group of smallest order, i.e., the unique smallest example of a group in which normality is not transitive.
* This is a non-abelian nilpotent group of smallest order, though not the only one.
The other such group is the quaternion group.
* It is the only group of its order that is isomorphic to its automorphism group.
* It is the only group of its order that is not a T-group.
* It is the only group of its order having two Klein four-subgroups.
In particular, it gives an example of a situation where the number of elementary abelian subgroups of order "Token14" is neither zero nor "Token30" modulo "Token24".
Contrast this with the case of odd "Token24", where we have the congruence condition on number of elementary abelian subgroups of prime-square order for odd prime.{{access GAP implementation online using SAGE|id=5013}}{{GAP ID|8|3}}{{HallSenior|8|4}}{| class="sortable" border="1"!

The group "Token8" constructed here is the dihedral group of order "Token1".
The first generator "Token13" maps to the ''rotation'' element of order four and the second generator "Token40" maps to a ''reflection'' element of order two.
It can be described as the holomorph of a group|holomorph of the cyclic group of order four.
For this, first define "Token21" to be the cyclic group of order four (using GAP:CyclicGroup|CyclicGroup), and then use GAP:SemidirectProduct|SemidirectProduct and GAP:AutomorphismGroup|AutomorphismGroup:<pre>C := CyclicGroup(4);G := SemidirectProduct(AutomorphismGroup(C),C);</pre>
Here, "Token8" is the dihedral group of order eight.
We can also construct it as a semidirect product of the Klein four-group and an automorphism of order two.<pre>K :
= DirectProduct(CyclicGroup(2),CyclicGroup(2));A := AutomorphismGroup(K);S := SylowSubgroup(A,2);G := SemidirectProduct(S,K);</pre>
Then, "Token8" is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order eight.

it is one of the subgroups occurring in an internal direct product decomposition of the whole group into (possibly more than two) subgroups.
Note that we also allow infinitely many subgroups, in which case, the internal direct product would correspond to the restricted external direct product.
|| there is a collection of subgroups "Token22" with "Token11" equal to one of the "Token8"s, such that "Token6" is the internal direct product of the "Token8"s.|}The equivalence of definitions follows largely from the equivalence of internal and external direct product.{{semibasicdef}}{{pivotal subgroup property}}{{variation of|normal subgroup}}{{subgroup property conjunction|normal subgroup|retract}}{{subgroup property
see examples}}Every group is the internal direct product of itself and the trivial subgroup.
Thus: The trivial subgroup is a direct factor of the whole group.
Every group is a direct factor of itself.
In a finite nilpotent group, all the Sylow subgroups are direct factors.
In particular, a finite nilpotent group is the direct product of its Sylow subgroups.
{{further|equivalence of definitions of finite nilpotent group}}
In a vector space, any vector subspace is a direct factor, because the complementary subspace can be taken as the complement for an internal direct product.
If a group "Token6" arises as the external direct product of finitely or infinitely many groups "Token7", then for any subset "Token21", the subset of "Token6" arising as those elements where all coordinates outside of "Token5
" are trivial is a direct factor of "Token6".
The complementary factor can be taken as the subgroup of "Token6" where all coordinates in "Token5" are trivial.
A similar observation holds for the restricted external direct product.{| class="sortable" border="1"!

This group is defined in a number of equivalent ways: It is the '''full octahedral group''': the group of all rigid symmetries (both orientation-preserving and orientation-reversing) of the regular octahedron.
It is the '''full cube group''': the group of all rigid symmetries (both orientation-preserving and orientation-reversing) of the cube.
It is the external direct product of the defining ingredient::symmetric group:S4|symmetric group of degree four and the defining ingredient::cyclic group:Z2|cyclic group of order two.
It is the automorphism group of the general linear group:GL(2,3), i.e., the general linear group of degree two over the field of three elements.
It is the wreath product of the cyclic group:Z2|cyclic group of order two and the symmetric group:S3|symmetric group of degree three.
In other words, it is the group "Token1" where "Token4" acts by coordinate permutations.
It is the signed symmetric group of degree three.
(Note: This is a reinterpretation of the previous definition as a wreath product).
It is the projective general linear group of degree two over the ring "Token0", i.e., it is the group "Token2".
Note that this is ''not'' the same as the group "Token3", which is the projective general linear group of degree two over field:F4 (and which is isomorphic to alternating group:A5, a group of order 60).{{GAP ID|48|48}}{| class="sortable" border="1"!

This group can be defined in the following equivalent ways: It is the external direct product of the group of rational numbers "Token3" and the group of rational numbers modulo integers "Token2".
Explicitly, it is the group "Token1".
It is the external central product of two copies of the group of rational numbers where we identify a copy of the group of integers in group of rational numbers in both groups with each other.
Explicitly, it is the central product of "Token0".
*
Amalgamated free product of two copies of group of rational numbers over group of integers
