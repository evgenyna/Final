Suppose G is a group and H is a subgroup of G.
We say that H is an AMALGAM-CHARACTERISTIC SUBGROUP of G if H is characteristic in the group L given by _ L _ = _ G _ * _ ( _ H _ ) _ G _.
In other words , L is the amalgam of G with itself over H , and H is treated as the subgroup of L given by the amalgamated H between the two factors.

This group , denoted $ C_5 , \ Z_5 , \ Z/5 \ Z$ , is defined in the following equivalent ways : * It is the cyclic group of order five.
* It is the additive group of the field of five elements.
